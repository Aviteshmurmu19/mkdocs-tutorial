MSE is about understanding what that stuff is made of, how it's put together, and why it acts the way it does.</p> <p>The goal is to be able to create new, better stuff or pick the perfect stuff for a specific job.</p> <p>Does that make sense as a starting point? We're just talking about the science of \"stuff.\"</p> <p>Okay, let's place the first piece of furniture in our house: the Golden Rule of this entire subject.</p> <p>Your professor, and this whole field, is obsessed with one idea:</p> <p>The way a material is built on a tiny, microscopic level determines how it behaves in the real world.</p> <p>We have two key words for this. Let's break 'em down.</p> <p>First word: Structure.</p> <p>This just means \"how the atoms are arranged.\"</p> <p>Think of it like LEGOs. You can take the same pile of LEGO bricks (the atoms) and arrange them in different ways. You can build a solid wall, or a hollow box, or a long chain. That arrangement is the structure.</p> <p>In materials, are the atoms packed super tight? Are they in a random mess? Are they linked up in long chains? That's the structure.</p> <p>Second word: Properties.</p> <p>This means \"what the material can do\" or \"how it behaves.\"</p> <p>Back to our LEGOs. The solid LEGO wall has the property of being strong and rigid. The long LEGO chain has the property of being flexible.</p> <p>So, for real materials, properties are things like:</p> <ul> <li>How hard is it? (Hardness)</li> <li>Does it bend or shatter? (Ductility vs. Brittleness)</li> <li>Does it conduct electricity? (Conductivity)</li> <li>Is it heavy or light? (Density)</li> </ul> <p>These are its properties.</p> <p>Now, let's put those two words together to make the Golden Rule of Materials Science:</p> <p>Structure Determines Properties.</p> <p>This is the single most important concept. The way you arrange the atoms (structure) dictates what the material can do (properties).</p> <p>This is why a diamond (carbon atoms in a strong, rigid structure) is super hard, but the graphite in your pencil (also carbon atoms, but in a weak, slippery structure) is soft. Same atoms, different structure, totally different properties.</p> <p>Here's an English vocab word for you: Fundamental. This means it's the most basic and important idea that everything else is built upon. This rule is fundamental to the whole course.</p>","tags":["Material Science","Atomic Bonding","Crystal Structure"]},{"location":"semester-7/CL-409/lecture-01/#check-in-quiz-1","title":"Check-in Quiz #1:","text":"<p>Okay, let's make sure that first brick is solid.

This is the formula that describes that force.

Let's break it down, piece by piece.</p> <p>The Breakdown (Line by Line):</p> <ul> <li> <p>\\(F_c\\) : This is just \"Force, coulombic.\" It's what we're trying to find. The bigger the number, the stronger the pull between the ions.</p> </li> <li> <p>\\(k_0\\) : This is just a constant number. You don't calculate it, you just look it up. It's a conversion factor to make the units work out. Don't sweat this one.</p> </li> <li> <p>\\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\) : These are the charges of the two ions. For a sodium ion (Na\u207a), Z is +1. For a chloride ion (Cl\u207b), Z is -1. For a magnesium ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a), Z is +2. Easy enough, right?</p> </li> <li> <p>\\(q\\) : This is the fundamental charge of a single electron. Again, it's just a constant number you look up. It's tiny.</p> </li> <li> <p>\\(a\\) : This is the most important part. This is the distance between the centers of the two ions. It's the \"bond length.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>The \\(a^2\\) on the bottom: This is the secret sauce of the whole formula. Because the distance is squared on the bottom, it has a huge effect on the force. This relationship is called inversely proportional. (Vocab alert: that means when one thing goes up, the other goes down, but in a very dramatic, non-linear way).</p> </li> </ul> <p>So, what does this formula actually tell us in real life?</p> <p>It tells us that the force holding a ceramic together gets insanely strong as you try to push the ions closer together.</p> <p>If you halve the distance (\\(a\\)), you don't double the force... you quadruple it (because of the \\(a^2\\)).

Gimme your take! \u2692\ufe0f\ud83e\udd18</p> <p>Bro, you are 100% on the right track with Option B, and that question about the negative sign is next-level. That's not a dumb question at all\u2014that's a legit brilliant question that shows you're actually thinking about the physics. Let's clear it up.</p> <p>You are absolutely right: Forces are vectors. The negative sign here is all about direction, not strength.</p> <p>How to Deal with the Negative Sign:</p> <p>In physics, especially with forces between particles, we use a simple convention:</p> <ul> <li>A negative force (<code>-F</code>) means the force is ATTRACTIVE (the ions are pulling each other together).</li> <li>A positive force (<code>+F</code>) means the force is REPULSIVE (the ions are pushing each other apart).</li> </ul> <p>Let's look at the formula again: \\(F_c = -\\frac{k_0(Z_1q)(Z_2q)}{a^2}\\)</p> <p>Now let's plug in the charges for your two pairs:</p> <ul> <li>Pair A (Na\u207a and Cl\u207b): \\(Z_1 = +1\\), \\(Z_2 = -1\\). So, \\((Z_1)(Z_2) = (1)(-1) = \\bf{-1}\\).</li> <li>Pair B (Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b): \\(Z_1 = +2\\), \\(Z_2 = -2\\). So, \\((Z_1)(Z_2) = (2)(-2) = \\bf{-4}\\).</li> </ul> <p>Notice that for an attractive pair (one positive, one negative), the product <code>(Z1)(Z2)</code> will always be negative.</p> <p>The formula has that leading negative sign out front. So when you calculate the final force, you get: <code>Force = - (a bunch of positive numbers) * (a negative number)</code> A negative times a negative equals a positive... wait, that's not right. Let me re-read the book's convention.</p> <p>Ah, my bad. Let's correct that. The book is defining the force of attraction, \\(F_c\\), as a positive value. To do that, the negative sign in the formula is there to cancel out the negative you get from multiplying a positive and negative charge.</p> <p>Let's redo that simply:</p> <ul> <li>The magnitude (the strength) of the force is proportional to the absolute value of the charges.</li> <li>For Pair A: <code>|(+1) * (-1)| = 1</code></li> <li>For Pair B: <code>|(+2) * (-2)| = 4</code></li> </ul> <p>So, the strength of the force for Pair B is 4 times stronger than for Pair A. Your intuition was perfect.</p> <p>The negative sign in the formula is just a physics convention to make the final answer come out a certain way depending on the context (potential energy vs. force). For this class, just focus on the magnitude. Bigger charges = bigger force. Simple as that.</p> <p>You crushed it. You not only got the right answer but you asked a question that gets to the heart of the physics.</p> <p>Ready to tackle the next piece of math?

While starting with a hydrophobic material helps, it is the micro/nano-scale texturing of the surface that creates the pockets of trapped air responsible for the superhydrophobic effect.

To form a dispersed system, you must have two distinct phases separated by an interface. Since any two gases will mix at the molecular level to form a single, homogeneous solution, it is impossible to form discrete \"droplets\" or \"particles\" of one gas within another.

Why did these ancient Indian thinkers even bother?</p> <p>In the West, we often think of philosophy as a purely academic thing, like arguing about abstract questions in a classroom. But in India, philosophy was seen as something much more practical. It was treated like a kind of medicine for the human condition.</p> <p>The fundamental problem they all tried to solve was suffering (the Sanskrit word is du\u1e25kha).</p> <p>Think about your own life. You get sick, you feel anxious, you get into arguments, you worry about the future. Your course notes actually break this down into three types of pain:</p> <ol> <li>Pain from within yourself: Like sickness, headaches, or mental stuff like stress, anger, and jealousy.</li> <li>Pain from the outside world: Like getting bitten by a mosquito, a person insulting you, or a natural disaster like an earthquake.</li> <li>Pain from supernatural forces: Stuff they considered to be from fate or the gods, like droughts, floods, or just plain bad luck you can't explain.</li> </ol> <p>So, the starting point for almost every Indian philosophical school is this very pessimistic, but realistic, idea: life is full of suffering. It\u2019s unavoidable. Even things that seem good, like pleasure, often lead to pain because they don't last, and we get attached to them.</p> <p>So, what's the \"medicine\"? The ultimate goal of all their thinking was to find a way to permanently end all suffering. Not just to feel better for a day, but to get out of the entire system of pain for good.</p> <p>This ultimate goal is called Mok\u1e63a (pronounced Moke-shah).</p> <p>Mok\u1e63a means Liberation or Freedom.</p> <p>Think of it like being stuck in a video game you can't win, and you keep having to respawn into a difficult level. Mok\u1e63a is finding the way to finally beat the game and put the controller down forever, achieving a state of absolute peace and freedom from the game's rules.</p> <p>So, to summarize this one big idea:</p> <p>Indian Philosophy is not just about thinking; it's a practical quest. It starts by recognizing that life is full of suffering, and its ultimate goal is to achieve Mok\u1e63a\u2014complete and permanent liberation from all that suffering.</p> <p>Each school of philosophy we're going to look at is basically a different \"map\" or \"strategy guide\" that claims to show the way to Mok\u1e63a.</p> <p>How does that sit with you? Does this idea of philosophy as a practical guide to end suffering make sense as our starting point?</p> <p>Let me know when you're ready, and we'll tackle the next small piece.

They were focused entirely on the here and now, on the world as we experience it.</p> <p>The most important thing to understand about the C\u0101rv\u0101ka school is their epistemology.

This means knowledge you get directly through your five senses: seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling.</p> <p>That's it. Full stop.</p> <p>If you can see a chair, the chair is real.

It's just using logic to figure something out that you haven't directly seen.</p> <p>The classic example they use in all Indian philosophy is this:</p> <p>You look at a distant hill. You see smoke rising from it. You don't see the fire, but you infer that there must be fire on the hill.</p> <p>This seems like simple, obvious logic, right? We do this a thousand times a day. Your phone is not in your pocket, so you infer you left it on the table.</p> <p>But the C\u0101rv\u0101kas said, \"Hold on. That's a huge, unproven leap of faith.\"</p> <p>They argued that this kind of inference is completely unreliable and can't be trusted as a source of certain knowledge. Here\u2019s their brilliant and devastating breakdown of why.</p> <p>For your inference \"There is fire because there is smoke\" to be 100% true, it has to rely on an unbreakable, universal rule. That rule is:</p> <p>\"Wherever there is smoke, there is fire.\"</p> <p>This universal rule is the backbone of the inference. In Sanskrit, they call this rule Vy\u0101pti (pronounced Vyaap-tee). Vy\u0101pti means an invariable, universal relationship between two things.</p> <p>The C\u0101rv\u0101kas then asked a killer question: \"How do you know that this Vy\u0101pti is true? How can you be so sure that smoke is always accompanied by fire?\"</p> <p>You might say, \"Well, I've seen it a million times! I've seen fire and smoke together at campfires, in kitchens, in forest fires...\"</p> <p>And this is where the C\u0101rv\u0101kas trap you. They say:</p> <p>\"Oh, so you've seen it a million times. But have you seen every single instance of smoke in the entire history of the universe\u2014past, present, and future? On this planet and on every other planet? What if there's some weird, magical smoke without fire somewhere that you've never seen? Since you haven't perceived all cases, you can't be 100% certain that the rule is universal. You are taking a leap of faith from the known (the smoke you've seen with fire) to the unknown (all the smoke you haven't seen).\"</p> <p>According to their own golden rule, knowledge has to be based on perception. And since you cannot possibly perceive every instance of smoke and fire to confirm the universal rule (the Vy\u0101pti), the rule itself is not proven.</p> <p>And if the universal rule (Vy\u0101pti) is not proven, then any inference based on that rule is just a guess. It might turn out to be right by chance, but it's not a valid path to certain knowledge.</p> <p>So, the core of their attack is this:</p> <p>Inference depends on knowing a universal rule (Vy\u0101pti). But we can never be 100% sure a universal rule is true because we can't perceive every single instance in the universe. Therefore, inference is an unreliable \"leap in the dark,\" not a valid source of knowledge.</p> <p>This was a massive bomb dropped on all other philosophical systems, because all of them (Ny\u0101ya, Ved\u0101nta, Buddhism, etc.) rely heavily on inference and logic to make their arguments about the soul, God, karma, and so on. The C\u0101rv\u0101kas were essentially saying, \"Your most basic tool of logic is broken.\"</p> <p>Does this breakdown make sense? How they attack the idea of a \"universal rule\" because it can't be fully perceived?

The Four Elements</p> <p>They looked at the world and asked, \"What can we perceive?\" They concluded that reality is made up of just four elements (bh\u016btas), because only these four can be perceived by the senses.</p> <ul> <li>Earth (You can see and touch it)</li> <li>Water (You can see, touch, and taste it)</li> <li>Fire (You can see and feel it)</li> <li>Air (You can feel it)</li> </ul> <p>That's it. That's the entire list of ingredients for the universe.</p> <p>Now, what's interesting is what they left out. All the other Indian schools accepted a fifth element: Ether or Space (\u0101k\u0101\u015ba). Why? Because they said you need space for things to exist in. But the C\u0101rv\u0101kas asked, \"Can you see space? Can you touch it? No.\" They argued that the existence of space is an inference, not a perception. So, according to their rule, it's not a real element.</p> <p>2. What About Consciousness? The Soul and the Mind</p> <p>This is where they get really radical. The other schools all believe in a soul (\u0101tman)\u2014some kind of non-physical, conscious entity that lives in the body.</p> <p>The C\u0101rv\u0101kas said, \"Nonsense. Have you ever seen a soul leave a body? Can you put a soul on a weighing scale? No.\"</p> <p>So, if there's no soul, where does consciousness come from? How can a lump of earth, water, fire, and air start thinking, feeling, and saying \"I\"?</p> <p>Their answer was revolutionary. They said that consciousness is an emergent property of matter.</p> <p>This means that consciousness isn't a separate \"thing.\" It's a quality that emerges when the four material elements are combined in a very specific way to form a living body. When the body dies, the elements break apart, and consciousness simply vanishes. Poof. Gone.</p> <p>Your course notes give two brilliant analogies they used to explain this:</p> <ul> <li>The Red Color in Paan: Think about making paan. You take betel leaf (green), areca nut (brownish), and slaked lime (white). None of these ingredients are red on their own. But when you chew them all together in the right proportion, a new quality\u2014redness\u2014emerges.</li> <li>The Intoxicating Power of Alcohol: You take yeast and grain. Neither of these things will get you drunk by themselves. But when you ferment them together in the right way, a new quality\u2014intoxicating power\u2014emerges.</li> </ul> <p>They said consciousness is exactly like that. The elements of earth, water, fire, and air are not conscious on their own. But when they combine to form a brain and a living body, the quality of \"consciousness\" just emerges from that specific material mixture.</p> <p>So, for them, the \"soul\" is nothing more than the conscious body itself. There is no ghost in the machine.</p> <p>To summarize C\u0101rv\u0101ka metaphysics: Reality is made of only four perceptible elements (earth, water, fire, air). Consciousness is not from a soul; it's a by-product that emerges from a specific combination of these elements in the body, and it disappears at death.</p> <p>How does that land with you? The idea of consciousness just being a side-effect of the body, like the redness from chewing paan?

The C\u0101rv\u0101kas said these are the only two worthwhile goals of human existence. The other traditional goals like righteous duty (Dharma) and liberation (Mok\u1e63a) were just fantasies invented by priests to control people.</p> <p>Their philosophy is often summed up in a famous (and controversial) verse quoted in your notes:</p> <p>\"While life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee [clarified butter] even though he runs in debt; When once the body becomes ashes, how can it ever return here?\"</p> <p>Let's break that down:</p> <ul> <li>\"While life remains, let a man live happily...\": This is it. This is your one shot. Don't waste it worrying about things you can't see, like gods or karma.</li> <li>\"...let him feed on ghee even though he runs in debt...\": Ghee was a symbol of richness and enjoyment. This is a radical way of saying you should prioritize your present happiness over abstract future consequences (like being in debt, or worse, worrying about bad karma).</li> <li>\"When once the body becomes ashes, how can it ever return here?\": This is their mic drop. Death is the absolute end. Game over. There are no do-overs, no rebirth. So, what are you saving your good deeds for?</li> </ul> <p>What about pain and suffering?</p> <p>Their critics would say, \"But isn't the pursuit of pleasure often mixed with pain?\" For example, farming is hard work, but it gives you food. Making money is stressful, but it gives you security.</p> <p>The C\u0101rv\u0101kas were practical about this. They weren't idiots who thought life could be 100% pleasure. Their advice was like this:</p> <p>\"You don't throw away the rice grains just because they're covered in a husk. You don't stop eating fish because you're afraid of the bones. And you don't stop lighting fires for warmth because you're afraid of the smoke.\"</p> <p>In the same way, a wise person should accept that life has some unavoidable pain, but still try to get the most pleasure out of it. Their ethics is about being a sensible hedonist\u2014someone who intelligently pursues pleasure.</p> <p>What is Liberation (Mok\u1e63a)?</p> <p>For every other school, Mok\u1e63a is a profound spiritual state. For the C\u0101rv\u0101kas, the answer was blunt and logical:</p> <p>Liberation is Death.</p> <p>Death is the only thing that brings a final, absolute end to all suffering. When your body disintegrates, your consciousness vanishes, and so does your capacity for pain.</p> <p>And that's the C\u0101rv\u0101ka school in a nutshell.

This means they accept the authority of the Vedas. But, as we talked about, they do it in their own unique way. The classical version of S\u0101\u1e45khya that we're studying is famously atheistic\u2014it doesn't need a creator God to explain the universe. So, right away, they're a strange and fascinating member of the \"orthodox\" team.</p> <p>The central idea of S\u0101\u1e45khya is DUALISM.</p> <p>This means they believe that all of reality, everything that exists, is made up of two, and only two, fundamentally different and independent principles.</p> <p>Imagine you have two boxes of building blocks that can never, ever be mixed. One box is made of something like pure energy, and the other is made of something like pure matter. S\u0101\u1e45khya says the entire universe is built from just these two things.</p> <p>These two ultimate realities are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Puru\u1e63a (pronounced Poo-roo-sha): This is Pure Consciousness. Think of it as the soul, the self, the spirit. But it's not a \"thing.\" It's just awareness. It is the silent, passive witness or observer of everything. It doesn't do anything; it just sees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prak\u1e5bti (pronounced Prak-ri-tee): This is Primordial Matter or Nature. This is the stuff that everything physical is made of. The entire universe\u2014from rocks and trees to our bodies, our minds, our thoughts, and even our egos\u2014is made from Prak\u1e5bti. It is unconscious, unthinking, but it is always active and constantly changing.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Let's put them side-by-side. This is maybe the most important chart for understanding S\u0101\u1e45khya:</p> Feature Puru\u1e63a (Consciousness) Prak\u1e5bti (Matter) Nature Pure Consciousness Unconscious Matter Activity Inactive, Passive, a Witness Active, Always Changing Awareness Conscious Non-conscious Role The Seer, The Subject The Seen, The Object Number There are MANY Puru\u1e63as (infinite individual souls) There is only ONE Prak\u1e5bti <p>The whole drama of the universe, according to S\u0101\u1e45khya, is the interaction between these two completely separate realities.</p> <p>Prak\u1e5bti is like a blind person who is incredibly strong and can walk anywhere, but doesn't know where to go. Puru\u1e63a is like a lame person who can't move at all, but has perfect eyesight and can see the destination.</p> <p>Separately, they are helpless. But if the lame man (Puru\u1e63a) sits on the blind man's (Prak\u1e5bti's) shoulders, they can work together to reach the goal. This is the famous S\u0101\u1e45khya analogy for how the universe works. Consciousness (Puru\u1e63a) guides the unconscious but active Matter (Prak\u1e5bti).</p> <p>The core idea of S\u0101\u1e45khya is a radical dualism. Reality consists of two independent principles: Puru\u1e63a (the many, passive, conscious selves) and Prak\u1e5bti (the one, active, unconscious matter). All of existence is an interaction between these two.</p> <p>How does this initial idea of the two fundamental forces, Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti, sit with you?

Creation is just a process of making the hidden become visible, the potential become actual.</p> <p>This theory is the foundation for their whole idea of Prak\u1e5bti.

It\u2019s not just a boring, uniform lump of stuff. S\u0101\u1e45khya says Prak\u1e5bti is a perfect balance, a state of equilibrium, of three fundamental forces or qualities called the Gu\u1e47as (pronounced Goo-nahs).</p> <p>Think of the Gu\u1e47as as the three primary colors of reality. You can mix them in different proportions to create every possible color, but the three primary colors are always there. Everything in the material world, from a rock to a thought, is made of a unique mixture of these three Gu\u1e47as.</p> <p>Let's meet the three Gu\u1e47as. Your notes and professor mention them as having colors (white, red, dark) and producing different feelings (pleasure, pain, indifference).</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sattva (The Illuminator)</p> <ul> <li>Nature: Purity, lightness, harmony, knowledge, happiness, pleasure.</li> <li>Function: It's the principle of manifestation. It allows things to be perceived and understood. Think of it like a clean mirror that can reflect light perfectly.</li> <li>Psychological Effect: When Sattva is dominant in your mind, you feel calm, clear, happy, and peaceful.</li> <li>Color: White.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Rajas (The Mover)</p> <ul> <li>Nature: Activity, motion, passion, energy, desire, restlessness, pain.</li> <li>Function: It's the principle of action. Rajas is the engine that drives everything. Without Rajas, Sattva and Tamas would just sit there, inert. It's the force that disturbs the balance and kicks off creation.</li> <li>Psychological Effect: When Rajas is dominant, you feel agitated, anxious, greedy, and constantly busy. It's the energy behind ambition but also behind suffering.</li> <li>Color: Red.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tamas (The Obscurer)</p> <ul> <li>Nature: Inertia, heaviness, darkness, ignorance, laziness, indifference.</li> <li>Function: It's the principle of resistance and stability. It covers and conceals things. Think of it like a heavy blanket that blocks light and movement.</li> <li>Psychological Effect: When Tamas is dominant, you feel lazy, depressed, confused, and dull.</li> <li>Color: Dark.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>The State of Prak\u1e5bti:</p> <p>Before the universe is created, these three Gu\u1e47as are in a state of perfect equilibrium. Imagine a perfectly still, clear pond. That's Prak\u1e5bti in its unmanifested state (called dissolution or pralaya). Nothing is happening.</p> <p>Creation begins when this equilibrium is disturbed. As your professor's notes say, it's the Rajas that starts vibrating, which then makes Sattva and Tamas vibrate. This causes a \"terrific commotion in the bosom of Prak\u1e5bti,\" and the process of evolution begins.</p> <p>Key Takeaway: Prak\u1e5bti is not a simple substance. It's a dynamic interplay of three fundamental forces called Gu\u1e47as: Sattva (purity, light), Rajas (activity, passion), and Tamas (inertia, darkness). The entire universe is just a combination of these three Gu\u1e47as in different proportions.</p> <p>So, does this idea of the three Gu\u1e47as as the building blocks of everything material make sense? The constant battle and cooperation between them is what creates the world we experience.</p> <p>Let me know when you're ready to tackle the final big mystery: How do the completely separate Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti even begin to interact?

They have absolutely nothing in common. As your professor said, \"How can I mix myself with the table?\" Yet, for the world to be created (for evolution to begin), they must interact. The \"lame man\" must get on the \"blind man's\" shoulders. So, how does this happen?</p> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya's Attempt #1: Real Contact Their first idea was simple: they come into contact.</p> <ul> <li>The Flaw: This was immediately shot down. How can something non-physical and passive \"contact\" something physical and active? It's a logical contradiction.</li> </ul> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya's Attempt #2: Mere Proximity (Nearness) Their next idea was more subtle. It's not a real contact, just the mere proximity of Puru\u1e63a is enough to trigger Prak\u1e5bti.</p> <ul> <li>The Analogy: A magnet can move iron filings without ever touching them. In the same way, the presence of the conscious Puru\u1e63a \"excites\" the unconscious Prak\u1e5bti, disturbs the equilibrium of the Gu\u1e47as, and starts the process of evolution.</li> <li>The New Flaw (Your professor pointed this out): Puru\u1e63a is eternal and all-pervading. Prak\u1e5bti is also eternal. This means they are ALWAYS near each other. If their nearness is all it takes, then evolution should be happening constantly, forever. There would be no quiet state of equilibrium (dissolution). The very idea of Prak\u1e5bti as a balanced state would be impossible.</li> </ul> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya's Attempt #3: A Semblance of Contact (Reflection) This was their final, most complex attempt. They said it's not a real contact, but a semblance of a contact.</p> <ul> <li>The Idea: The pure, conscious Puru\u1e63a gets reflected in the Buddhi (the intellect), which is the very first product of Prak\u1e5bti. It's like your face being reflected in a mirror. You aren't in the mirror, but your reflection is.</li> <li>It is this reflection of Puru\u1e63a, not the real Puru\u1e63a, that gets entangled with matter. The real Puru\u1e63a mistakenly identifies with its own reflection in the intellect, and this false identification is what drives the whole show.</li> <li>The Killer Flaw (Your professor called this \"nonsense\"): This creates an impossible chicken-and-egg problem. The Buddhi is the first evolute of Prak\u1e5bti. How can it exist before evolution begins in order to receive the reflection of Puru\u1e63a? It can't.</li> </ul> <p>So, as your professor said, S\u0101\u1e45khya \"commits blunder after blunder\" trying to solve this one initial mistake of making Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti completely separate.</p> <p>So, what does this all mean for us? This brings us to Bondage and Liberation.</p> <p>Bondage (Suffering): Bondage is not real. It's based on this fundamental mistake, this false identification. The pure Puru\u1e63a, which is just a witness, looks at its reflection in the mind/intellect/ego (all products of Prak\u1e5bti) and thinks:</p> <ul> <li>\"I am happy.\"</li> <li>\"I am in pain.\"</li> <li>\"I am doing this.\"</li> <li>\"This is my body.\"</li> </ul> <p>In reality, the Puru\u1e63a is never in pain and never does anything. It's all just the play of the Gu\u1e47as within Prak\u1e5bti. As your professor's transcript mentions, it's like watching a bloody movie on a white screen. We cry and laugh, but the screen itself is never affected. We, the Puru\u1e63as, are the screen. The movie is Prak\u1e5bti. Bondage is forgetting you are the screen and thinking you are the characters in the movie.</p> <p>Liberation (Kaivalya): If bondage is caused by ignorance, then liberation is achieved through true knowledge.</p> <ul> <li>The Knowledge: It is the profound, unshakable realization of the absolute distinction between Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti. It's the moment the Puru\u1e63a realizes: <p>\"I am not the body. I am not the mind. I am not the ego. I am not my thoughts or feelings. I am the pure, eternal, unchanging consciousness that is simply witnessing all of this.\"</p> </li> <li>Once this discriminative knowledge dawns, the Puru\u1e63a withdraws its identification. Prak\u1e5bti, like a dancer who has finished her performance for the audience, ceases to evolve for that particular Puru\u1e63a.</li> <li>This state of ultimate freedom and isolation is Kaivalya. It is the final goal. The \"disabled passenger\" realizes he was never in the car to begin with; he was just watching it from afar.</li> </ul> <p>And that's it, bro! We've covered all the core concepts from your notes and lectures for all three topics. We've laid the foundation, explored the C\u0101\u1e45rv\u0101ka rebels, and now we've navigated the complex dualism of S\u0101\u1e45khya. You are officially caught up.</p> <p>How are you feeling?

You are 100% right that they believe in \"seeing things\" (perception). That's perfect. The tiny mix-up is the fifth element. The five elements are Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space).

Their whole philosophy is: \"What you see is what you get.\" Everything is just one thing: Matter.</p> </li> <li> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya starts with \"S\". Think of \"S\" for Split. They split reality into two things. They are the complicated dualists. They belong to Team \u0100stika (the orthodox ones, even though they're atheists). Their whole philosophy is: \"There's the stuff you see (Prak\u1e5bti), and the one who is seeing (Puru\u1e63a).\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>Mantra to remember: C\u0101rv\u0101ka = Common Sense Materialists. S\u0101\u1e45khya = Split Reality Dualists.</p> <p>Answer 3 (S\u0101\u1e45khya's Two Realities):</p> <p>\"prakriti and the other one is purusha\" Your Grade: A+ (Perfect!) Exactly right. You remembered the two core principles of S\u0101\u1e45khya perfectly.</p> <p>Answer 4 (C\u0101rv\u0101ka Critique of Lightning/Thunder):</p> <p>\"since nobody and neither you have seen all the possibilities of what The lightning is in all of this time so you cannot come to a conclusion that thunder will be coming\" Your Grade: A (Excellent Understanding!) This is a fantastic answer. You perfectly captured their logic. You understood that they attack the \"universal rule\" because we haven't seen all instances.

You've got the most important part right: the soul (Puru\u1e63a) cannot be sad. This is the core of S\u0101\u1e45khya liberation. The sadness itself is an event happening in Prak\u1e5bti. More specifically, it's a modification of your mind/intellect/ego, which are all products of Prak\u1e5bti. So, why does it feel like you are sad? Because of false identification.

The C\u0101rv\u0101ka rejects this Vy\u0101pti because its truth cannot be established by perception.

The Puru\u1e63a, being pure consciousness, is a passive witness and can never truly be sad. We feel sad due to ignorance (avidy\u0101), which causes the Puru\u1e63a to falsely identify with the states of the mind. It's like the Puru\u1e63a seeing sadness in its reflection in the mind and mistakenly thinking 'I am sad.'\"</p> <p>See the difference?

He might feel bad so the player is in false identification of being dead in the game?</p> <p>Yes please use more English words because I don't use this type of word while writing but I see in everyday life, so inferences similar to perception right? Charvaka rejected vyapti as he says that vyapti cannot be proved by perception, so your vyapti is not actually vyapti as you cannot prove it. Yes this line I remember and I really liked it a leap from known to unknown, is not a valid source of knowledge</p> <p>Will internal organs would be included in prakriti or is it in, I forgot the other one what was that, purusa? I am little bit confused is it like this if others make me feel sad then my internal organs and my intellect get sad and therefore my soul gets false perception and soul is also sad? We feel sad due to ignorance? ignorance meant like ignoring things like for getting things on not giving priority to certain things so why does it says that ignorance here and why being ignorant causes purusa to falsely identify with what is the state of mind?</p> <p>My professor has set the paper like it has many 6 to 8 questions and from them I have to write any two short note answers and answers any one paragraph, I mean short notes are not short they are like 1-2 paragraphs long but the essay like really long, like one page long</p> <p>Excellent questions, bro. You're pushing past just memorizing and into really understanding it. Let's clear up these specific points. This is exactly what we need to do.</p> <p>1. \"I will forget Sanskrit terms like Vy\u0101pti.\" Totally normal. Don't stress about memorizing every single one. If you can't remember \"Vy\u0101pti,\" just describe the concept. Writing \"the universal, invariable rule that inference depends on, like 'all smoke is caused by fire'\" is 100% as good. Your professor will see you understand the idea, which is way more important than knowing the Sanskrit word. Focus on the concept, not just the label.</p> <p>2. Your Game Analogy for S\u0101\u1e45khya: Is it Correct?</p> <p>\"He might feel bad so the player is in false identification of being dead in the game?\"</p> <p>YES! BRO, THIS IS A PERFECT ANALOGY. Hold on to this one. It's brilliant.</p> <ul> <li>The Game World = Prak\u1e5bti (The world of action, events, objects, sadness, happiness).</li> <li>The In-Game Character = Your body, mind, and ego (They are part of the game world, made of Prak\u1e5bti).</li> <li>The Player (You, on the couch) = The Puru\u1e63a (The pure consciousness, the witness. You are outside the game).</li> </ul> <p>When your character in the game dies, do you die? No. But you might get angry, sad, or frustrated. You react as if it happened to you. That emotional reaction is the false identification. You've temporarily forgotten the difference between yourself (the player) and your in-game avatar.</p> <p>Liberation (Kaivalya) is like putting the controller down, stepping back, and realizing, \"Oh, it was just a game. My character's death doesn't affect my true self at all.\" You've achieved discriminative knowledge\u2014the knowledge that the player and the character are separate.</p> <p>3. Confusion Point: \"Is Inference similar to Perception?\" Great question. No, they are considered opposites in this context.</p> <ul> <li>Perception (Pratyak\u1e63a): Is direct knowledge. You see the fire. It's immediate, through your senses.</li> <li>Inference (Anum\u0101na): Is indirect knowledge. You see the smoke and logically conclude there is fire. It requires a mental step, a logical leap.</li> </ul> <p>The C\u0101rv\u0101kas trust perception because it's direct. They distrust inference because it's indirect and relies on that \"leap from the known to the unknown.\"</p> <p>4. Confusion Point: \"Will internal organs be included in Prak\u1e5bti or Puru\u1e63a?\" This is a super important point to clarify.</p> <p>EVERYTHING except pure consciousness is Prak\u1e5bti. So, your internal organs (mind, intellect, ego) are all subtle forms of matter. They are products of Prak\u1e5bti. They are part of the \"in-game character,\" not the \"player.\"</p> <p>\"if others make me feel sad then my internal organs and my intellect get sad and therefore my soul gets false perception and soul is also sad?\"</p> <p>You are 99% right here. Let's just fix one tiny word. The soul never gets sad. The soul has a false perception that it is sad. It's a trick of the light, a reflection. The sadness is 100% contained within the internal organs (Prak\u1e5bti). The Puru\u1e63a is just the screen the sad movie is playing on; it never becomes sad itself.</p> <p>5. Confusion Point: \"Why does it say 'ignorance' here?\" This is a fantastic question about language. In philosophy, \"ignorance\" (avidy\u0101) doesn't mean ignoring things or being uneducated. It means something much deeper.</p> <p>Philosophical Ignorance = A fundamental misapprehension of reality.</p> <p>It's not about what you know, but a mistake in how you know. The root ignorance in S\u0101\u1e45khya is the failure to distinguish between the self (Puru\u1e63a) and the not-self (Prak\u1e5bti). It's a deep-seated, cosmic confusion that we are all born with. It's the default state of the human mind. So, we feel sad due to this fundamental misunderstanding of who we truly are.</p>","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","Q&A","Quiz","Exam Preparation","S\u0101\u1e45khya","C\u0101rv\u0101ka","Puru\u1e63a","Prak\u1e5bti","Ignorance","Avidy\u0101","Inference","Satk\u0101ryav\u0101da"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/lecture-13/#lets-talk-about-your-exam-structure","title":"Let's Talk About Your Exam Structure","text":"<p>Okay, so two short notes (1-2 paragraphs each) and one long essay (one page).

It is like i know what each objects are but i cannot place it appropriately in a house to decorate it.</p> <p>Part A: Satkaryava is a theory to explain the metaphysics of universe. Sankhya the cheif follower of satkaryavada, belives that there are two separate realitites. That are soul (Atman) and Prakriti. Both are completely independent of each other. It's main claim was if soul realises that it is disconnected from prakriti then it will achieve liberation. Soul is like the white sheet and prakriti is the projector that projects film on to the white sheet. Film can be of happy, sad, or anger, and the sheet might look like it, but whatever the film is, sheet will be always be white with no film on it, or else it will loose its purpose. It's effect is that the soul will feel false feeling in respose to what happens in prakriti. One argument that Sankhya makes is that (I do not remember his example)?</p> <p>Part B: The main difference between Carvaka and Sankhya is that Carvaka only belived in perception and not in inference. Perception is what you see, and what you see, smell, touch, hear is real. (I do not remember points that made them distinct).Carvaka argued that if four elements is mixed aprropriately then soul can exist. For Carvaka, soul is not a core/base element, but is a product of all the four elements. Sankhya belived in atman and prakriti and they cannot interact with each other but can only come in proximity to observe prikiti. Prakriti need someone to observe and soul is like a lone observer. For Sankhya, ones ultimate goal is to be aware that soul is nothing but an observer and any activities in prakriti does not affect any changes of soul. It is out mind that can experiece feeling. Soul has no feeling. For charvaka, for a soul to exist it need an eviornment to exist in which is made up of four elements.</p> <p>Bro, first off, stop being so hard on yourself.

Its main claim is that the effect pre-exists in its material cause in an unmanifested or potential form before it is produced. According to this view, creation is not a new beginning, but simply a transformation of the cause into the effect.</p> <p>One of the main arguments S\u0101\u1e45khya uses to support this is that you cannot produce something from nothing. For example, you can get oil from seeds because oil already pre-exists in the seeds, but you cannot get oil from sand because it does not. This shows that for an effect to be produced, it must already be potentially contained within its specific cause.\"</p> <p>See how that is focused only on the question? And it uses the key terms from our toolkit.</p> <p>Part B: C\u0101rv\u0101ka vs. S\u0101\u1e45khya on the Self (The Essay) Again, you have ALL the right ideas here. Your answer is a bit jumbled, but the ingredients are correct. We just need to structure it like an essay. An essay needs an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p> <p>Here is a model structure for your one-page essay:</p> <p>Model Essay Structure for Part B:</p> <p>(Introduction - 1 Paragraph)</p> <ul> <li>Start by introducing both schools. \"The C\u0101rv\u0101ka and S\u0101\u1e45khya schools offer two completely opposite views on the nature of the self in Indian philosophy. C\u0101rv\u0101ka, a N\u0101stika school, presents a purely materialist view, while S\u0101\u1e45khya, an \u0100stika school, argues for a dualistic reality of matter and pure consciousness.\"</li> </ul> <p>(Body Paragraph 1: C\u0101rv\u0101ka's View - 2 Paragraphs)</p> <ul> <li>Explain their view of consciousness. \"The C\u0101rv\u0101kas, relying only on perception, reject the existence of an immaterial soul. They argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the four material elements, just as the red color emerges from chewing paan. The 'self' is nothing more than the conscious, living body. At death, when the elements disperse, consciousness vanishes completely.\"</li> <li>Explain their goal of life. \"Consequently, the goal of life for a C\u0101rv\u0101ka is to maximize pleasure in this life. Concepts like rebirth and liberation are rejected as meaningless fantasies. The only 'liberation' is death, as it is the final end of existence and suffering.\"</li> </ul> <p>(Body Paragraph 2: S\u0101\u1e45khya's View - 2 Paragraphs)</p> <ul> <li>Explain their view of consciousness. \"In stark contrast, S\u0101\u1e45khya's dualism posits that the self, or Puru\u1e63a, is pure, eternal, and unchanging consciousness. It is completely separate from the material world of Prak\u1e5bti. The Puru\u1e63a is a passive witness, and unlike the C\u0101rv\u0101ka view, it is not a product of matter but an independent reality. S\u0101\u1e45khya also believes in a plurality of Puru\u1e63as.\"</li> <li>Explain their goal of life. \"The suffering we experience is due to the false identification of the Puru\u1e63a with the activities of Prak\u1e5bti (the mind and body). Therefore, the ultimate goal is liberation (Kaivalya), which is achieved through discriminative knowledge. This is the profound realization of the absolute separateness of the Puru\u1e63a from Prak\u1e5bti, leading to the end of all suffering.\"</li> </ul> <p>(Conclusion - 1 Paragraph)</p> <ul> <li>Summarize the key difference. \"In conclusion, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka view sees the self as a temporary, physical phenomenon, while S\u0101\u1e45khya sees it as an eternal, non-material consciousness. This fundamental difference in their metaphysics leads to vastly different ethics: one focused on worldly enjoyment and the other on spiritual liberation from the material world.\"</li> </ul> <p>See how we used the blueprint to build a strong, clear, and well-organized essay?

References are found to it in the epics and in the early Buddhistic literature. Garbe says: 'Several vestiges show that even in the pre-Buddhistic India proclaimers of purely materialistic doctrines appeared.'\u00b9 It must have arisen as a protest against the excessive monkdom of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a priests. The externals of ritualism which ignored the substance and emphasized the shadow, the idealism of the Upani\u1e63ads unsuited to the commoners, the political and the social crises rampant in that age, the exploitation of the masses by the petty rulers, monks and the wealthy class, the lust and greed and petty dissensions in an unstable society paved the way for the rise of Materialism in India in the post-Upanisadic and pre-Buddhistic age. But Materialism in Indian Philosophy has never been a force. Born in discontent, it soon died in serious thought. Though the materialistic way of life, the way of enjoying the pleasures of the senses and the flesh is as old as humanity itself and will surely last as long as humanity lasts, yet Materialism as metaphysics has never found favour with the Indian philosophers. Jainism and Buddhism arose immediately and supplied the ethical and spiritual background which ejected Materialism.</p> <p>B\u1e5bhaspati, a heretical teacher, is regarded as the traditional founder of this school. His S\u016btra, which we have no reason to doubt, has unfortunately perished. Sometimes this B\u1e5bhaspati is equated with the teacher of the gods who propagated materialism among the Asuras so that they might be ruined. Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka, after whose name this school is so called, is said to be the chief disciple of B\u1e5bhaspati. According to another view, Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka is the name of the founder of this school. According to still another view, the word 'Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka' is not a proper name, but a common name given to a materialist, and it signifies a person who believes in 'eat, drink and be merry' (the root 'charv' means to eat), or a person who eats up his own words, or who eats up all moral and ethical considerations,\u00b2 or a person who is 'sweet-tongued' (charuv\u0101k) and</p> <p>\u00b9 The Philosophy of Ancient India, p. 25. \u00b2 charvante punyap\u0101p\u0101dikam vastuj\u0101tam iti Ch\u0101rv\u0101k\u0101\u1e25.</p> <p>Page 41</p> <p>therefore whose doctrine is superficially attractive. Another synonym of Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka is Lok\u0101yata which means a commoner and therefore, by implication, a man of low and unrefined taste. N\u0101stika-Shiromani or an 'arch-heretic' is another name for a materialist. In R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, they are called 'fools who think themselves to be wise and who are experts in leading people to doom and ruin'.\u00b9 References to them are also found in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Manusa\u1e43hit\u0101.\u00b2 In Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, i, we find a reference to Ajitakeshakambalin, a materialist, probably so called because he must be having a blanket of hair with him, who believed only in perception and in four elements. Sh\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita also refers to him as Kambal\u0101shvatara (the man with a blanket and a mule).\u00b3</p> <p>No original work of this school is extant with the single exception of a much later work, Tattvopaplavasimha of Jayar\u0101shi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, published by the Oriental Institute of Baroda in 1940. It is therefore very difficult to have a correct idea of it. Our chief sources of information are given in the works of the other schools. But this is done only to refute materialism. Thus we find the tenets of materialism often misrepresented. The weak points in this school are exaggerated and the strong points are omitted.

The validity even of inference is rejected. Inference is said to be a mere leap in the dark. We proceed here from the known to the unknown and there is no certainty in this, though some inferences may turn out to be accidentally true. A general proposition may be true in perceived cases, but there is no guarantee that it will hold true even in unperceived cases. Deductive inference is vitiated by the fallacy of petitio principii. It is merely an argument in a circle since the conclusion is already contained in the major premise the validity of which is not proved. Inductive inference undertakes to prove the validity of the major premise of deductive inference. But induction too is uncertain because it proceeds unwarrantedly from the known to the unknown. In order to distinguish true induction from simple enumeration, it is pointed out that the former, unlike the latter, is based on a causal relationship which means invariable</p> <p>\u00b9 ki\u1e47v\u0101dibhyo madashaktivad vij\u00f1\u0101nam. \u00b2 chaitanyavishi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 k\u0101ya\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. \u00b3 k\u0101ma evaikah puru\u1e63\u0101rtha\u1e25. \u2074 mara\u1e47amev\u0101 pavarga\u1e25. \u2075 Chapter I.</p> <p>Page 43</p> <p>association or vy\u0101pti. Vy\u0101pti therefore is the nerve of all inference. But the Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka challenges this universal and invariable relationship of concomitance and regards it a mere guess-work. Perception does not prove this vy\u0101pti. Nor can it be proved by inference, for inference itself is said to presuppose its validity. Testimony too cannot prove it, for, firstly, testimony itself is not a valid means of knowledge and secondly, if testimony proves vy\u0101pti, inference would become dependent on testimony and then none would be able to infer anything by himself. Hence inference cannot be regarded as a valid source of knowledge. Induction is uncertain and deduction is argument in a circle. The logicians, therefore, find themselves stuck up in the mud of inference.\u00b9</p> <p>It is interesting here to note that Sh\u016bnyav\u0101da Buddhism and Advaita Ved\u0101nta also have rejected the ultimate validity of inference. There has been a long controversy between Udayana, the logician and Shr\u012bhar\u1e63a, the Ved\u0101ntin regarding the validity of inference and Sh\u012bhar\u1e63a has denounced all attempts to prove the validity of inference. But there is a radical difference between the Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka view on the one hand, and the Sh\u016bnyav\u0101da and the Ved\u0101nta view on the other. The Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka accepts the validity of perception and thereby upholds the truth of the means of valid knowledge, though he rejects all other means of knowledge as invalid. But the Sh\u016bnyav\u0101din and the Advaitin reject the ultimate validity of all means of knowledge as such including perception, though they insist on the empirical validity of all means of knowledge. The distinction between ultimate and empirical knowledge is unknown to the Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka. To accept the validity of perception and, at the same time and from the same standpoint, to reject the validity of inference is a thoughtless self-contradiction.</p> <p>The crude Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka position has been vehemently criticized by all systems of Indian Philosophy all of which have maintained the validity of at least perception and inference. To refuse the validity of inference from the empirical standpoint is to refuse to think and discuss. All thoughts, all discussions, all doctrines, all affirmations and denials, all proofs and disproofs are made possible by inference. The Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka view that perception is valid and inference is invalid is itself a result of inference. The Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka can understand others only through inference and make others understand him only through inference. Thoughts and ideas, not being material objects, cannot be perceived; they can only be inferred. Hence the self-refuted Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka position is called sheer nonsense and no system of philosophy. Perception itself which is regarded as valid by the Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka is often found untrue. We perceive the earth as flat but it is almost round. We perceive the earth as static</p> <p>\u00b9 vishe\u1e63e'nugam\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101t s\u0101m\u0101nye siddhas\u0101dhan\u0101t. anum\u0101bha\u1e45gapa\u1e45ke'smin nimagn\u0101 v\u0101didantina\u1e25.</p> <p>Page 44</p> <p>but it is moving round the sun. We perceive the disc of the sun as of a small size, but it is much bigger than the size of the earth. Such perceptual knowledge is contradicted by inference. Moreover, pure perception in the sense of mere sensation cannot be regarded as a means of knowledge unless conception or thought has arranged into order and has given meaning and significance to the loose threads of sense-data. The Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka cannot support his views without giving reasons which presuppose the validity of inference.\u00b9</p>","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","C\u0101rv\u0101ka","Lok\u0101yata","Materialism","Epistemology","Metaphysics","Pratyak\u1e63a","Anum\u0101na","Vy\u0101pti","B\u1e5bhaspati"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/01%20Carvak%20Philosophy/#iv","title":"IV","text":"","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","C\u0101rv\u0101ka","Lok\u0101yata","Materialism","Epistemology","Metaphysics","Pratyak\u1e63a","Anum\u0101na","Vy\u0101pti","B\u1e5bhaspati"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/01%20Carvak%20Philosophy/#metaphysics","title":"METAPHYSICS","text":"<p>THE Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka admits the existence of four elements\u2014earth, water, fire and air\u2014only and he rejects the fifth, the ether, because it is not perceived but inferred. Similarly, soul and God and the Hereafter are rejected. Everything which exists, including the mind, is due to a particular combination of these four elements. The elements are eternal, but their combinations undergo production and dissolution. Consciousness is regarded as a mere product of matter. It is produced when the elements combine in a certain proportion. It is found always associated with the body and vanishes when the body disintegrates. Just as the combination of betel, areca nut and lime produces the red colour,\u00b2 or just as fermented yeast produces the intoxicating quality in the wine,\u00b3 though the ingredients separately do not possess either the red colour or the intoxicating quality, similarly a particular combination of the elements produces consciousness, though the elements separately do not possess it. Consciousness is the result of an emergent and dialectical evolution. It is an epi-phenomenon, a by-product of matter. Given the four elements and their particular combination, consciousness manifests itself in the living body. 'Matter secretes mind as liver secretes bile.' The so-called soul is simply the conscious living body. God is not necessary to account for the world and the values are a foolish aberration. Sad\u0101nanda in his Ved\u0101ntas\u0101ra mentions four different materialistic schools. One identifies the soul with the gross body (sth\u016bla shar\u012bra); another with the senses (indriya); another with vital breaths (pr\u0101\u1e47a) and the last with the mental organ (manas).\u2074 All the schools agree in regarding the soul as a product of matter. Sh\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita says that the materialist Kambal\u0101shvatara maintains the view that consciousness arises out of the material body associated with vital breaths.\u2075</p> <p>\u00b9 Tattvasa\u1e45graha, K. 1456. \u00b2 Sarvasiddh\u0101ntasa\u1e45graha, 27. \u00b3 Sarvadarshanasa\u1e45graha, ch. I. \u2074 Ved\u0101ntas\u0101ra, p 26-27. \u2075 Tattvasa\u1e45graha, K. 1864.</p> <p>Page 45</p> <p>Severe and contemptuous criticism has been levelled against this doctrine by all schools of Indian Philosophy. If consciousness means self-consciousness as it means in the human beings, then it cannot be identified with the living body. The animals also possess the living body, but not rational consciousness. The Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka replies that it is a particular combination of the elements which obtains only in the human body that produces consciousness and that therefore living human body and consciousness are always associated together and nobody has seen consciousness apart from the living human body. But the argument is wrong. If consciousness is an essential property of the human body, it should be inseparable from it as the Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka claims. But it is not. In swoons, fits, epilepsy, dreamless sleep etc. the living body is seen without consciousness. And on the other hand, in dreams, consciousness is seen without the living body. When a dreamer awakes, he disowns the dream-body but owns the dream-consciousness. The dream-objects are sublated in the waking life, but the dream-consciousness is not contradicted even in the waking life. When a person gets up after seeing a tiger in a dream, he realizes that the tiger is unreal, being only a dream-tiger, but the fact that he saw a tiger in a dream remains a fact even in the waking life. This proves that consciousness persists through the three stages of waking life, dream life and deep sleep life and is much superior to material body which is its instrument and not its cause. Moreover, the subject, the knower cannot be reduced to the object, the 'known, since all objects presuppose the existence of the subject. Again, the subject is the enjoyer and the object is the enjoyed and the two cannot be identified. Again, the mere fact that consciousness is not experienced without the material body, is no argument to prove that it is a mere product of matter. The eye, e.g., cannot see in darkness. Sight is not possible without light, yet light cannot be regarded as the cause of sight. Mere co-existence is not causation. The two horns of a bull which are always found together cannot be regarded as causally related. The body is a mere instrument for the manifestation of consciousness and cannot be regarded as its cause. Moreover, if consciousness is a property of the body, it must be perceived like other material properties, But it is neither smelt nor tasted nor seen nor touched nor heard. Again. if consciousness is a property of the body, then there should be no consciousness of the body, for why should the body, qualified to produce consciousness, itself stand in need of being manifested by consciousness? Further, if it is a property of matter, then like other material properties it should be known by all in the same manner and should not be private. But we find that consciousness is intimately private and consciousness of an individual cannot be shared by others. Again, if the existence of the soul surviving death cannot be demonstrated, its non-existence too cannot be so demonstrated.</p>","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","C\u0101rv\u0101ka","Lok\u0101yata","Materialism","Epistemology","Metaphysics","Pratyak\u1e63a","Anum\u0101na","Vy\u0101pti","B\u1e5bhaspati"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/02%20Philosophy%20Introduction/","title":"02 | Philosophy: An Introduction to Indian Philosophy","text":"","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","Introduction","Metaphysics","Epistemology","\u0100stika","N\u0101stika","Karma","Mok\u1e63a","Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/02%20Philosophy%20Introduction/#02-philosophy-an-introduction-to-indian-philosophy","title":"02 | Philosophy: An Introduction to Indian Philosophy","text":"","tags":["Indian Philosophy","HS 467","Introduction","Metaphysics","Epistemology","\u0100stika","N\u0101stika","Karma","Mok\u1e63a","Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha"]},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/02%20Philosophy%20Introduction/#the-nature-of-philosophy-and-the-human-quest","title":"The Nature of Philosophy and the Human Quest","text":"<p>Human beings are unique in their capacity for reflection and inquiry.

In stark contrast to the religious, spiritual, or metaphysical systems like Ved\u0101nta, S\u0101\u1e43khya, or Buddhism, C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophy holds that matter alone is real, and consciousness, thought, and life are products of material combinations.</p> <ul> <li>The mind and consciousness are by-products of the physical body, not separate substances.</li> <li>All so-called higher phenomena (such as emotions, intellect, selfhood) emerge from the interaction of material elements.</li> </ul> <p>B\u1e5bhaspati is traditionally regarded as the founder of this school, though no authentic primary text by him survives.

The self is just a name for the conscious, living body.</li> <li>Rejection of Transcendence: No rebirth, no karma theory, no liberation (mok\u1e63a).

Furthermore, we cannot even perceive the universal \"smokeness\" itself, as we haven't perceived all instances of smoke. What is true for the perceived cases may not be true for unperceived ones.</li> </ul> <p>2. The Argument from Inherent Nature (Svabh\u0101va): If there is no universal law, how can we explain the uniformities we experience (e.g., fire is always hot, water is always cool)?</p> <ul> <li>C\u0101rv\u0101ka Reply: These uniformities are due to the inherent nature (svabh\u0101va) of things. No supernatural principle or universal law is needed to account for the properties of objects. Moreover, there is no guarantee that uniformities observed in the past will continue in the future.</li> </ul> <p>3. The Problem with Causal Relations: Can we base vy\u0101pti on a causal relation (fire causes smoke)?</p> <ul> <li>C\u0101rv\u0101ka Reply: A causal relation is just another kind of invariable relation and faces the same difficulties. Repeated observation is not enough to establish it, because one must be certain that there is no other unperceived condition on which the relation depends.</li> <li>Example: A person who has only seen fire with smoke might infer the presence of smoke whenever they see fire.

We find references to the S\u0101\u1e45khya-Yoga doctrines in some of the Upani\u1e63ads, e.g., in the Chh\u0101ndogya,\u00b9 the Pra\u015bna,\u00b2 the Ka\u1e6dha\u00b3 and particularly in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara;\u2074 in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata;\u2075 in the G\u012bt\u0101;\u2076 and in the Sm\u1e5btis and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, repeatedly refers to the view whether the S\u0101\u1e45khya can be regarded as the teaching of the Upani\u1e63ads and rejects it,\u2077 besides undertaking refutation of the S\u0101\u1e45khya in the Tarkap\u0101da on rational grounds. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101ch\u0101rya regards it as the 'main opponent' (pradh\u0101na-malla) of Ved\u0101nta and says that though S\u0101\u1e45khya and Yoga are generally accepted by the wise as conducive to the Highest Good, yet these systems advocate dualism and cannot be supported by the \u015aruti. These words are used in the \u015aruti and the Sm\u1e5bti in the sense of knowledge and action respectively and words like Mahat, Avyakta etc. are used in the sense of names and forms.\u2078 The fact that B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a and \u015aa\u1e45kara are keen to reject the view that S\u0101\u1e45khya, though accepted by the wise, is not based on the Upani\u1e63ads because it advocates dualism, suggests that there must have been some thinkers belonging to the S\u0101\u1e45khya who claimed it to be the teaching of the Upani\u1e63ads. Though nothing can be said with absolute certainty, it seems highly probable that the S\u0101\u1e45khya in the beginning was based on the Upani\u1e63ads and had accepted the theistic Absolute, but later on, under the influence of the Jaina and the Buddhist thought, it rejected theistic monism and was content with spiritualistic pluralism and atheistic realism. And it is this S\u0101nkhya to which B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a and \u015aa\u1e45kara are opposed. This also explains why some of the later S\u0101\u1e45khyas, e.g. Vij\u00f1\u0101nabhik\u1e63u in the sixteenth century, tried to revive the earlier theism in S\u0101\u1e45khya.</p> <p>Tradition regards Kapila as the founder of this system. But S\u0101\u1e45khya-pravachana-s\u016btra which is attributed to him is generally regarded by</p> <p>\u00b9 IV, 5, 1. \u00b2 VI, 2. \u00b3 I, 3, 10-13. \u2074 IV, 5, 10, 12, 16; VI, 10, 13, 18. \u2075 XII, 318; Shantiparva 303-308. \u2076 II, 39; III, 42; V, 4-5. \u2077 I, 1, 5-11; II, 1, 1-3. \u2078 \u015aa\u1e45kara-Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, 1, 5-10; I, 4, 1-3 and 28; II, 1, 3.</p> <p>Page 150</p> <p>scholars as a work of the fourteenth century A.D., because it has been referred to by the earlier writers of the other schools, because it criticizes the rival systems and because it wants to revive theism. So far as theism is concerned, we maintain that the original S\u0101\u1e45khya was theistic. But the fact that this work has been ignored and \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's K\u0101rik\u0101 has been referred to instead by the other earlier writers as well as the fact that it criticizes other systems go against this view. But being regarded as that of Kapila himself, as \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a himself speaks of Kapila, \u0100suri, and Pa\u00f1cha\u015bikha, it seems probable that these were historical personages whose works have been lost. Kapila certainly flourished before Buddha and he must have composed S\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra which work was unfortunately lost long ago. \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's S\u0101\u1e45khya-K\u0101rik\u0101 seems to be the earliest available and the most popular work of this system. Besides this we have Gau\u1e0dap\u0101da's S\u0101\u1e45khya-K\u0101rik\u0101-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, V\u0101chaspati Mi\u015bra's Tattva-Kaumud\u012b and Vij\u00f1\u0101na-bhik\u1e63u's S\u0101\u1e45khya-pravachana-bh\u0101\u1e63ya.</p> <p>The word 'S\u0101\u1e45khya' is derived from the word 'sa\u1e45khy\u0101' which means right knowledge as well as number. The G\u012bt\u0101 uses this word in the sense of knowledge, so does the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata at other places. Also S\u0101\u1e45khya means the philosophy of right knowledge (samyak khy\u0101ti or j\u00f1\u0101na). The system is predominantly intellectual and theoretical. Right knowledge is the knowledge of the separateness of the Puru\u1e63a from the Prak\u1e5bti. Yoga, as the counterpart of S\u0101\u1e45khya, means action or practice and tells us how the theoretical metaphysical teachings of S\u0101\u1e45khya might be realized in actual practice. Thus S\u0101\u1e45khya-Yoga forms one complete system, the former being the theoretical while the latter being the practical aspect of the same teaching. S\u0101\u1e45khya is also the philosophy of numbers, because it deals with twenty-five categories. As a philosophy of numbers, it might have influenced the Pythagorean philosophy.</p> <p>\u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (fifth century A.D.) is the representative of the classical S\u0101\u1e45khya which had divorced itself from the Upani\u1e63ads under the influence of Jainism and Buddhism, yet the Ved\u0101ntic teaching of absolutism with which the original S\u0101\u1e45khya was associated, asserts itself implicitly in \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We have seen that absolutism is implicit in Jainism and explicit in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism and we shall see how it is implicit in \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also.</p> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya maintains a clear-cut dualism between Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti and further maintains the plurality of the Puru\u1e63as, and is silent on God. It is a pluralistic spiritualism and an atheistic realism and an uncompromising dualism.</p> <p>Page 151</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#ii","title":"II","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#theory-of-causation","title":"THEORY OF CAUSATION","text":"<p>LET us first consider the S\u0101\u1e45khya theory of causation on which its doctrine of Prak\u1e5bti is based. The basic question involved in any theory of causation is: Does the effect pre-exist in its material cause? Those who answer this question in the negative are called Asatk\u0101ryav\u0101dins, while those who answer it in the affirmative are called Satk\u0101ryav\u0101dins. According to the former, the effect is a new creation, a real beginning. The effect (k\u0101rya) does not pre-exist (asat) in its material cause. Otherwise, there would be no sense in saying that it is produced or caused. If the pot already exists in the clay and the cloth in the threads and curd in milk, then why should the potter exert himself in producing the pot out of the clay, and why should not the threads serve the purpose of the cloth and why should not milk taste like curd? Moreover, its production would be its repeated birth which is nonsense. Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, H\u012bnay\u0101na Buddhism, Materialism and some followers of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 believe in Asatk\u0101ryav\u0101da, which is also known as \u0100rambhav\u0101da, i.e., the view that production is a new beginning. Materialism believes in Svabh\u0101vav\u0101da; H\u012bnay\u0101na Buddhism in Anitya-param\u0101\u1e47uv\u0101da or K\u1e63a\u1e47abha\u1e45gav\u0101da and Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and some followers of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 in Nitya-par\u0101m\u0101\u1e47u-k\u0101ra\u1e47av\u0101da. The Satk\u0101ryav\u0101dins, on the other hand, believe that the effect is not a new creation, but only an explicit manifestation of that which was implicitly contained in its material cause. Here, another important question arises: Is the effect a real transformation or an unreal appearance of its cause? Those who believe that the effect is a real transformation of its cause are called Pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101dins (pari\u1e47\u0101ma = real modification); while those who believe that it is an unreal appearance are called Vivartav\u0101dins (vivarta = unreal appearance). S\u0101\u1e45khya, Yoga and R\u0101m\u0101nuja believe in Pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101da. The view of S\u0101\u1e45khya-Yoga is called Prak\u1e5bti-pari\u1e47\u0101ma-v\u0101da, while the view of R\u0101m\u0101nuja is called Brahma-pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101da. \u015a\u016bnyav\u0101da, Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da and \u015aa\u1e45kara believe in Vivartav\u0101da. Their views may be respectively called \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101-vivarta-v\u0101d\u0101, Vij\u00f1\u0101na-vivarta-v\u0101da and Brahma-vivarta-v\u0101da. The view of Jainism and of Kum\u0101rila may be called Sadasatk\u0101ryav\u0101da because according to them the effect is both real as well as unreal before its production\u2014real as identical with the cause and unreal as a modal change thereof, though ultimately both incline towards Pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101da.</p> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya believes in Satk\u0101ryav\u0101da. All material effects are the modification (pari\u1e47\u0101ma) of Prak\u1e5bti. They pre-exist in the eternal bosom</p> <p>Page 152</p> <p>of Prak\u1e5bti and simply come out of it at the time of creation and return to it at the time of dissolution. There is neither new production nor utter destruction. Production means development or manifestation (\u0101vir-bh\u0101va); destruction means envelopment or dissolution (tirobh\u0101va). Production is evolution; destruction is involution. S\u0101\u1e45khya gives five arguments in support of Satk\u0101ryav\u0101da:</p> <p>(1) If the effect does not pre-exist in its cause, it becomes a mere nonentity like the hare's horn or the sky-flower and can never be produced (asadakaran\u0101t). (2) The effect is only a manifestation of its material cause, because it is invariably connected with it (up\u0101d\u0101nagraha\u1e47\u0101t). (3) Everything cannot be produced out of everything. This suggests that the effect, before its manifestation, is implicit in its material cause (sarvasambhav\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101t). (4) Only an efficient cause can produce that for which it is potent. This again means that the effect, before its manifestation, is potentially contained in its material cause. Production is only an actualization of the potential (\u015baktasya \u015bakya-kara\u1e47\u0101t). Were it not so, then curd should be produced out of water, and cloth out of reeds, and, oil out of sand-particles. (5) The effect is the essence of its material cause and as such identical with it. When the obstructions in the way of manifestation are removed, the effect naturally flows out of its cause. The cause and the effect are the implicit and the explicit stages of the same process. The cloth is contained in the threads, the oil in the oil-seeds, the curd in the milk.

The products are caused, dependent, relative, many and temporary as they are subject to birth and death or to production and destruction; but Prak\u1e5bti is uncaused, independent, absolute, one and eternal, being beyond production and destruction. The extreme subtleness of Prak\u1e5bti makes it unmanifest and imperceptible; we infer its existence through its products. Motion is inherent in it in the form of Rajas. As the source of the inanimate world, it is unconscious. The entire world of objects is implicit in the bosom of Prak\u1e5bti. Evolution is the explicit manifestation of this world of objects, while dissolution is the returning of this world to Prak\u1e5bti. S\u0101\u1e45khya believes that consciousness cannot be regarded as the source of the inanimate world, as Ved\u0101nta and Mah\u0101y\u0101na believe, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unintelligent world. On the other hand, the material atoms of the physical elements too cannot be regarded as the cause of this world, as Ch\u0101rv\u0101kas, Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, Jainism and H\u012bnay\u0101na Buddhism, and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 wrongly believe, because they cannot explain the subtle products of matter like intellect, mind and ego (these are different from pure consciousness which belongs to Puru\u1e63a alone, and are regarded here as internal organs), and further because the unity of the universe points to a single cause while the atoms are scattered and many. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible, eternal and one Prak\u1e5bti alone is the final source of this world of objects which is implicitly and potentially contained in its bosom.</p> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya gives five proofs for the existence of Prak\u1e5bti which are as follows:</p> <p>(1) All individual things in this world are limited, dependent, conditional and finite. The finite cannot be the cause of the universe. Logically we have to proceed from the finite to the infinite, from the limited to the unlimited, from the peros to the aperos, from the temporary to the permanent, from the many to the one. And it is this infinite, unlimited, eternal and all-pervading Prak\u1e5bti which is the source of this universe (bhed\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 parim\u0101\u1e47\u0101t). (2) All worldly things possess certain common characteristics by which they are capable of producing pleasure, pain and indifference. Hence there must be a common source composed of three Gu\u1e47as, from which all worldly things arise (samanvay\u0101t). (3) All effects arise from the activity of the potent cause. Evolution means the manifestation of the hitherto implicit as the</p> <p>Page 154</p> <p>explicit. The activity which generates evolution must be inherent in the world-cause. And this cause is Prak\u1e5bti (k\u0101ryata\u1e25 prav\u1e5btte\u015bcha). (4) The effect differs from the cause and hence the limited effect cannot be regarded as its own cause. The effect is the explicit and the cause is the implicit state of the same process. The effects, therefore, point to a world-cause where they are potentially contained (k\u0101ra\u1e47ak\u0101ryavibh\u0101g\u0101t). (5) The unity of the universe points to a single cause. And this cause is Prak\u1e5bti. (avibh\u0101g\u0101t vai\u015bvar\u016bpyasya).\u00b9</p> <p>Prak\u1e5bti is said to be the unity of the three Gu\u1e47as held in equilibrium (gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101my\u0101vasth\u0101). The three Gu\u1e47as are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. They are the constituents of Prak\u1e5bti and through it of the worldly objects. Being subtle and imperceptible their existence is inferred from their effects\u2014pleasure, pain and indifference respectively. Although they are called Gu\u1e47as, yet they are not ordinary qualities or attributes like the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Gu\u1e47as. They themselves possess qualities like lightness, activity, heaviness etc. They are extremely fine and ever-changing elements. They make up Prak\u1e5bti which is nothing apart from them. They are not the qualities which Prak\u1e5bti, the substance, possesses; on the other hand they themselves constitute Prak\u1e5bti. They are the factors or the constituents or the elements of Prak\u1e5bti. They are called Gu\u1e47as\u00b2 because they are the elements of Prak\u1e5bti which alone is called substantive; or because they are subservient to the end of the Puru\u1e63a, or because they are intertwined, like three strands, to make up the rope of Prak\u1e5bti which binds the Puru\u1e63as.</p> <p>Sattva literally means real or existent and is responsible for the manifestation of objects in consciousness. It is called goodness and produces pleasure. It is light and bright, buoyant (laghu) and illuminating (prak\u0101\u015baka). Luminosity of light, power of reflection, upward movement, pleasure, happiness, contentment, bliss are all due to it. Its colour is white. Rajas, which literally means foulness, is the principle of motion. It produces pain. Restless activity, feverish effort and wild stimulation are its results. It is mobile (chala) and stimulating (upa\u1e63\u1e6dambhaka). Its colour is red. Tamas, which literally means darkness, is the principle of inertia. It produces apathy and indifference. Ignorance, sloth, confusion, bewilderment, passivity and negativity are its results. It is heavy (guru) and enveloping (vara\u1e47aka) and as such is opposed to Sattva. It is also opposed to Rajas as it arrests activity. Its colour is dark. These three gu\u1e47as which constitute Prak\u1e5bti are never separate. They</p> <p>\u00b9 bhed\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 parim\u0101\u1e47\u0101t samanvay\u0101t k\u0101ryata\u1e25 prav\u1e5btte\u015bcha. k\u0101ra\u1e47ak\u0101ryavibh\u0101g\u0101d avibh\u0101g\u0101d vai\u015bvar\u016bpyasya, S\u0101\u1e45khya-K\u0101rik\u0101, 15. \u00b2 Gu\u1e47a means 'quality', 'secondary' and 'strand of a rope'.</p> <p>Page 155</p> <p>conflict and yet co-operate with one another and are always found intermingled. They are compared to the oil, the wick and the flame of a lamp, which, though opposed, yet co-operate to produce the light of a lamp. They are imperceptible and are inferred from their effects. All things are composed of these three gu\u1e47as and their differences are due to the different combinations of these gu\u1e47as. The nature of a thing is determined by the preponderance of a particular gu\u1e47a. Things are called good, bad or indifferent; intelligent, active or slothful; pure, impure or neutral, on account of the predominance of sattva, rajas or tamas respectively. When these gu\u1e47as are held in a state of equilibrium, that state is called Prak\u1e5bti. Evolution of worldly objects does not take place at this state. These gu\u1e47as are said to be ever-changing. They cannot remain static even for a moment. Change is said to be of two kinds\u2014homogeneous or sar\u016bpa-pari\u1e47\u0101ma and heterogeneous or vir\u016bpa-pari\u1e47\u0101ma. During the state of dissolution (pralaya) of the world, the gu\u1e47as change homogeneously, i.e., sattva changes into sattva, rajas into rajas and tamas into tamas. This change does not disturb the equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as and unless the equilibrium is disturbed and one predominates over the other two, evolution cannot take place. Evolution starts when there is heterogeneous change in the gu\u1e47as and one predominates over the other two and brings about terrific commotion in the bosom of Prak\u1e5bti.</p> <p>The nature of these gu\u1e47as is beautifully brought out in a Hindi couplet by Rasalina. The poet says that the eyes of the beloved are white, red and dark, and are full of nectar, intoxication and poison, with the result that once they pierce the heart of the lover, he experiences the joy of life, the agony of restlessness and the inertia of death. The recollection of the beloved gives him joy and makes life worth living; separation causes acute pain and makes him restless; intensity of love makes him forget everything and become inactive, unconscious and almost dead.\u00b9 Sattva is white and is like nectar and gives joy; rajas is red and is like intoxication and gives pain; tamas is dark and is like poison and produces unconsciousness. 'We bow to Prak\u1e5bti,' says \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, 'the red-white-dark, the unborn mother and \u201cnurse and receptacle of all generation\u201d.'\u00b2 Such is the conception of Prak\u1e5bti in S\u0101\u1e45khya.</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#iv","title":"IV","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#purusa","title":"PURU\u1e62A","text":"<p>THE other of the two co-present co-eternal realities of S\u0101\u1e45khya is the Puru\u1e63a, the principal of pure Consciousness.

The body, the senses, the mind and the intellect are all means to realize the end of the Puru\u1e63a. The three gu\u1e47as, the Prak\u1e5bti, the subtle body\u2014all are said to serve the purpose of the self. Evolution is teleological or purposive. Prak\u1e5bti evolves itself in order to serve the Puru\u1e63a's end. This proof is teleological (sa\u1e45gh\u0101tapar\u0101rthatv\u0101t). (2) All objects are composed of the three gu\u1e47as and therefore logically presuppose the existence of the Puru\u1e63a who is the witness of these gu\u1e47as and is himself beyond them. The three gu\u1e47as imply the conception of a nistraigu\u1e47ya\u2014that which is beyond them. This proof is logical (trigu\u1e47\u0101diviparyay\u0101t). (3) There must be a transcendental synthetic unity of pure Consciousness to co-ordinate all experiences. All knowledge necessarily presupposes the existence of the self. The self is the foundation (adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na), the fundamental postulate of all empirical knowledge. All affirmations and all negations equally presuppose it. Without it, experience would not become experience. This proof is ontological (adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101t). (4) Non-intelligent Prak\u1e5bti cannot experience its products. So there must be an intelligent principle to experience the worldly products of Prak\u1e5bti. Prak\u1e5bti is the enjoyed (bhogy\u0101) and so there must be an enjoyer (bhokt\u0101). All objects of the world have the characteristics of producing pleasure, pain and bewilderment. But pleasure, pain and bewilderment have meaning only when there is a conscious principle to</p> <p>\u00b9 tasm\u0101chcha vipary\u0101s\u0101t siddha\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63itvam asya puru\u1e63asya. kaivalyam m\u0101dhyastham d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5btvam akart\u1e5bbh\u0101va\u015bcha, S\u0101\u1e45khya-K\u0101rik\u0101, 19.</p> <p>Page 157</p> <p>experience them. Hence Puru\u1e63a must exist. This argument is ethical (bhokt\u1e5bbh\u0101v\u0101t). (5) There are persons who try to attain release from the sufferings of the world. The desire for liberation and emancipation implies the existence of a person who can try for and obtain liberation. Aspiration presupposes the aspirant. This proof is mystical or religious (kaivaly\u0101rtham prav\u1e5btte\u1e25).\u00b2</p> <p>Unlike Advaita Ved\u0101nta and like Jainism and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, S\u0101\u1e45khya believes in the plurality of the Puru\u1e63as. Like the J\u012bvas of the Jainas, the souls of R\u0101m\u0101nuja and the monads of Leibnitz, the S\u0101\u1e45khya Puru\u1e63as are subject to qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism. The selves are all essentially alike; only numerically are they different. Their essence is consciousness. Bliss is regarded as different from consciousness and is the product of the sattvagu\u1e47a. S\u0101\u1e45khya gives the following three arguments for proving the plurality of the Puru\u1e63as:</p> <p>(i) The souls have different sensory and motor organs and undergo separate births and deaths. Had there been only one Puru\u1e63a, the birth or death of one should have meant the birth or death of all and any particular experience of pleasure, pain or indifference by one should have been equally shared by all. Hence the souls must be many. (ii) If the self were one, bondage of one should have meant bondage of all and liberation of one should have meant liberation of all. The activity of one should have made all persons active and the sleep of one should have lulled into sleep all other persons. (iii) Though the emancipated souls are all alike and differ only in number as they are all beyond the three gu\u1e47as, yet the bound souls relatively differ in qualities also, since in some sattva predominates, while in others rajas, and in still others tamas. Hence their difference.</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#v","title":"V","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#evolution","title":"EVOLUTION","text":"<p>We have seen that Prak\u1e5bti is regarded as essentially dynamic.

It is only when heterogeneous change takes place and rajas vibrates and makes sattva and tamas vibrate that the equilibrium is disturbed and evolution takes place. Sattva, the principle of manifestation and rajas, the principle of activity were formerly held in check by tamas, the principle of non-manifestation and non-activity. But when rajas, the principle of activity vibrates and makes the other two vibrate, the process of creation begins. And creation is not the new creation of the worldly objects, but only their manifestation. It is only making explicit of that which was formerly implicit. Evolution is regarded as cyclic and not linear. There is no continuous progress in one direction, but alternating periods of evolution (sarga) and dissolution (pralaya) in a cyclic order. Evolution is again said to be teleological and not mechanical or blind. Evolution takes place for serving the purpose of the Puru\u1e63a. Prak\u1e5bti, the gu\u1e47as, the senses, the mind, the ego, the intellect, the subtle body\u2014all are constantly serving the end of the Puru\u1e63a. This end is either worldly experience (bhoga) or liberation (apavarga). Puru\u1e63a needs Prak\u1e5bti for enjoyment as well as for liberation, for sa\u1e41s\u0101ra as well as for Kaivalya. Evolution supplies objects to be enjoyed to the Puru\u1e63a and also works for his liberation by enabling him to discriminate between himself and Prak\u1e5bti.</p> <p>Now the question is: How does evolution take place? Evidently when heterogeneous motion arises and rajas disturbs the equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as. But how is the equilibrium disturbed? S\u0101\u1e45khya fails to answer this question satisfactorily. The fundamental blunder of S\u0101\u1e45khya has been to separate Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a as absolute and independent entities. As a matter of fact, the subject and the object are two aspects of the same reality which holds them together and yet transcends them. All realistic pluralism, of whatever brand it may be, has failed to answer this question satisfactorily. If Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a are absolutely separate and independent entities, then they can never unite together, nor can there be any tertium quid to unite them. And if they cannot unite evolution cannot take place. S\u0101\u1e45khya says that the disturbance of the equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as which starts evolution is made possible by the contact of Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti. Puru\u1e63a without Prak\u1e5bti is lame and Prak\u1e5bti without Puru\u1e63a is blind. 'Theory without practice is empty and practice without theory is blind.' 'Concepts without percepts are empty and percepts without concepts are blind.' Prak\u1e5bti needs Puru\u1e63a in order to be known, to be seen, to be enjoyed (dar\u015ban\u0101rtham); and Puru\u1e63a needs Prak\u1e5bti in order to enjoy (bhoga) and also in order to obtain liberation (apavarga), in order to discriminate between himself and Prak\u1e5bti and thereby obtain emancipation (kaivaly\u0101rtham). If Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a remain separate, there is dissolution. For creation they must unite. Just as a lame man</p> <p>Page 159</p> <p>and a blind man can co-operate and the lame may sit on the shoulders of the blind and point to him the way, while the blind may walk and thus both can reach the destination, though neither of them could have done that separately, similarly the inactive Puru\u1e63a and the non-intelligent Prak\u1e5bti co-operate to serve the end, and this union disturbs the equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as and leads to evolution.\u00b9 But how can the two opposed and independent entities really come into contact? S\u0101\u1e45khya realizes this difficulty and in order to avoid it says that there is no real contact between Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti and that only the proximity of the Puru\u1e63a, only the fact that Puru\u1e63a is near to Prak\u1e5bti (puru\u1e63a-sannidhi-m\u0101tra), is sufficient to disturb the equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as and thus lead to evolution. But here S\u0101\u1e45khya falls into another difficulty. The Puru\u1e63a being always near to Prak\u1e5bti (for the inactive Puru\u1e63a cannot move), evolution should never stop and dissolution would become impossible. Evolution, then, would be beginningless and the very conception of Prak\u1e5bti as the state of equilibrium of the three gu\u1e47as would be impossible. S\u0101\u1e45khya finds itself between these two horns of a dilemma\u2014either no contact and hence no evolution or else no equilibrium and hence no Prak\u1e5bti and no dissolution. In order to avoid these difficulties, S\u0101\u1e45khya now posits the theory of the semblance of a contact (sa\u1e41yog\u0101bh\u0101sa). Of course, there is no real contact (sa\u1e41yoga) between Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti; there is the semblance of a contact and it is this semblance which leads to evolution. Puru\u1e63a is reflected in the intellect (buddhi) and wrongly identifies himself with his own reflection in the buddhi. It is this reflection of the Puru\u1e63a which comes into contact with Prak\u1e5bti and not the Puru\u1e63a himself. But buddhi or mahat is regarded as the first evolute of Prak\u1e5bti and how can it arise before evolution to receive the reflection of the Puru\u1e63a? To avoid this difficulty it is said that the Puru\u1e63a is reflected in the Prak\u1e5bti itself. If so, then liberation and dissolution would become impossible because Prak\u1e5bti being always there and it being the essential nature of the Puru\u1e63a to identify himself with his reflection in the Prak\u1e5bti, he would never get liberation and the very purpose for which evolution starts would get defeated. Moreover, the reflection being always there, there would be no dissolution and so no equilibrium of the gu\u1e47as and hence no Prak\u1e5bti. Again, if semblance of a contact is sufficient to disturb the equilibrium, then evolution itself becomes a semblance of evolution, an appearance only (vivarta) and no real transformation (pari\u1e47\u0101ma) of Prak\u1e5bti. Thus we see that in order to defend the initial blunder of regarding Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti as absolute and independent entities, S\u0101\u1e45khya commits blunders after blunders.</p> <p>\u00b9 puru\u1e63asya dar\u015ban\u0101rtha\u1e41 kaivaly\u0101rtha\u1e41 tath\u0101 pradh\u0101nasya. pa\u1e45gvandhavad ubhayor api sa\u1e41yogas tatk\u1e5bta\u1e25 sarga\u1e25, Ibid, 21.</p> <p>Page 160</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#vi","title":"VI","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#the-evolutes","title":"THE EVOLUTES","text":"<p>THE first product of the evolution is called Mahat, the Great.

It is made of finest matter and is thus capable of reflecting clearly the consciousness of the Puru\u1e63a, like a wireless set capable of receiving the aerial waves. On account of the reflection of the Puru\u1e63a in it, it becomes apparently conscious and intelligent. The senses, the mind and the ego function for buddhi or intellect which functions directly for the Puru\u1e63a. Its functions are said to be ascertainment and decision. It arises when sattva predominates. Its original attributes are virtue (dharma), knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na), detachment (vair\u0101gya) and power (ai\u015bvarya). When it gets vitiated by tamas, these attributes are replaced by their opposites. Memories and recollections are stored in buddhi.</p> <p>Mahat produces Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra. It is the principle of individuation. Its function is to generate self-sense (abhim\u0101na). It produces the notion of the 'I' and the 'mine'. It is the individual ego-sense. Puru\u1e63a wrongly identifies himself with this ego and knows himself as the agent of actions, desirer of desires and striver for ends, and possessor and enjoyer of ideas, emotions and volitions and also of material objects. Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra is said to be of three kinds:</p> <p>(1) Vaik\u0101rika or s\u0101ttvika, when sattva predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it produces manas and five sensory organs and five motor organs. Viewed as psychological, it produces good deeds. (2) Bh\u016bt\u0101di or t\u0101masa, when tamas predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it produces the five subtle elements (tan-m\u0101tras). Viewed as psychological, it leads to indifferent acts or to idleness and sloth. (3) Taijasa or r\u0101jasa, when rajas predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it supplies the energy by which the S\u0101ttvika and the T\u0101masa produce their respective evolutes. Viewed as psychological, it produces evil deeds.</p> <p>Manas or mind which arises from the S\u0101ttvika Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra is the subtle and central sense-organ. It can come into contact with the several sense-organs at the same time. According to the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika</p> <p>Page 161</p> <p>School, manas is eternal and atomic and cannot come into contact with several senses simultaneously. According to S\u0101\u1e45khya, it is neither eternal nor atomic. It is made up of parts and so can come into contact with the different senses simultaneously. S\u0101\u1e45khya assigns to manas the important function of synthesizing the sense-data into determinate perceptions, passing them on to the ego, and carrying out the orders of the ego through the motor organs.</p> <p>The S\u0101ttvika Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra produces, besides manas, the five sensory and the five motor organs. The five sensory organs (j\u00f1\u0101nendriya) are the functions of sight, smell, taste, touch and sound. According to the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, the five sensory organs are derived from the five gross physical elements. But according to the S\u0101\u1e45khya, the five senses are the functions of the mind and are derived from Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra. The five motor organs (karmendriya) are the functions of speech, prehension, movement, excretion and reproduction.</p> <p>Buddhi, aha\u1e45k\u0101ra and manas represent the three psychological aspects of knowing, willing and feeling or cognition, conation and affection respectively. S\u0101\u1e45khya calls them material and derives them from Prak\u1e5bti. They shine through the light of the Puru\u1e63a and are apparently conscious. All the three are called the internal organs or anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a and vital breaths (pr\u0101\u1e47as) are said to be their modifications. The five sensory and the five motor organs together are called the ten external organs or b\u0101hyakara\u1e47a. These are the thirteen kara\u1e47as or organs of the S\u0101\u1e45khya.</p> <p>From the T\u0101masa Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra arise the five subtle essences which are called Tanm\u0101tras or 'things-in-themselves'. These are the essences of sight, smell, taste, touch and sound. Unlike the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ones, they are not derived from the gross elements. Rather the gross elements themselves arise out of these. They are neither the qualities nor the differentia of the gross elements nor the functions which are the sensory organs, but the subtle essences which produce the gross elements as well as their qualities. From the essence of sound (\u015babdatanm\u0101tr\u0101) arises the element of ether (\u0101k\u0101\u015ba) together with the quality of sound. From the essence of touch combined with the essence of sound, arises the element of air together with the qualities of sound and touch. From the subtle essence of colour or sight combined with those of sound and touch, arises the element of fire or light together with the qualities of sound, touch and colour. From the essence of taste combined with those of sound, touch and colour, arises the element of water together with the qualities of sound, touch, colour and taste. And lastly, from the essence of smell combined with those of sound, touch, colour and taste, arises the element of earth together with the qualities of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell.</p> <p>Evolution is the play of these twenty-four principles which, together</p> <p>Page 162</p> <p>with the Puru\u1e63a who is a mere spectator and outside the play of evolution, are the twenty-five categories of S\u0101\u1e45khya. Out of these twenty-five principles, the Puru\u1e63a is neither a cause nor an effect; Prak\u1e5bti is only the cause and not the effect; Mahat, Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra and the five subtle essences are both causes and effects; while the five sensory and the five motor organs and the five gross elements and manas are effects only.\u00b9 This may be depicted by the following table:</p> 1. Prak\u1e5bti 2. Mahat 3. Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra 4. Manas 5-9. Sensory organs 10-14. Motor organs 15-19. Tan-m\u0101tr\u0101s 20-24. Mah\u0101bh\u016btas (The 25th is the Puru\u1e63a, untouched by this evolution) <p>The evolution is teleological. Everything works to serve the purpose of the Puru\u1e63a though unconsciously. Just as non-intelligent trees grow fruits, or water flows on account of the declivity of the soil, or iron-filings are attracted towards a magnet, or milk flows through the udders of the cow in order to nourish the calf, similarly everything unconsciously tends to serve the purpose of the Puru\u1e63a, whether it is enjoyment or liberation.\u00b2 Prak\u1e5bti is the benefactress of Puru\u1e63a. Though Puru\u1e63a is inactive and indifferent and devoid of qualities, yet the virtuous and the generous Prak\u1e5bti which is full of qualities and goodness ceaselessly works through various means in a spirit of detachment for the realization of the Puru\u1e63a, without any benefit to herself.\u00b3 Prak\u1e5bti works to liberate the Puru\u1e63a.\u2074 There is immanent teleology in Prak\u1e5bti. Though Puru\u1e63a is neither a cause nor an effect, yet relatively it is he who should be regarded as the efficient cause as well as the final cause of evolution though S\u0101\u1e45khya regards Prak\u1e5bti as both the material and the efficient cause. He is like Aristotle's God, the unmoved mover who is beyond evolution. God, the pure intelligence, like the Puru\u1e63a, does not actively participate in evolution. He is the end towards which the creation moves. And the creation moves by His mere presence. The gu\u1e47as, which mutually differ and yet always co-operate, work like the oil, wick and flame of a lamp and illuminate the entire purpose of the Puru\u1e63a and present it to the buddhi or the intellect.\u2075 All the organs work for the realization of the Puru\u1e63a's end and for no other end.\u2076 The subtle body too works for the sake of the Puru\u1e63a's end.\u2077 Thus the whole creation unconsciously tends</p> <p>\u00b9 m\u016blaprak\u1e5btir avik\u1e5btir mahad\u0101dy\u0101\u1e25 prak\u1e5btivik\u1e5btaya\u1e25 sapta. \u1e63o\u1e0da\u015bakas tu vik\u0101ro na prak\u1e5btir na vik\u1e5bti\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25, Ibid, 3. \u00b2 Ibid, 57. \u00b3 Ibid, 60. \u2074 Ibid, 58. \u2075 Ibid, 36. \u2076 Ibid, 31. \u2077 Ibid, 42.</p> <p>Page 163</p> <p>towards the realization of the purpose of the Puru\u1e63a. And creation will continue till all the Puru\u1e63as are liberated. The entire evolution of Prak\u1e5bti, therefore, right from the first evolute, the Mahat, up to the last evolutes, the gross elements, is for the purpose of liberating each individual Puru\u1e63a.\u00b9</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#vii","title":"VII","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#bondage-and-liberation","title":"BONDAGE AND LIBERATION","text":"<p>THE earthly life is full of three kinds of pain. The first kind, called \u0101dhy\u0101tmika, is due to intra-organic psychophysical causes and includes all mental and bodily sufferings. The second, \u0101dhibhautika, is due to extra-organic natural causes like men, beasts, birds, thorns etc. The third, \u0101dhidaivika, is due to supernatural causes like the planets, elemental agencies, ghosts, demons etc. Wherever there are gu\u1e47as there are pains. Even the so-called pleasures lead to pain. Even the life in heaven is subject to the gu\u1e47as. The end of man is to get rid of these three kinds of pain and sufferings. Liberation means complete cessation of all sufferings which is the summum bonum, the highest end of life (Apavarga or Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha).</p> <p>Puru\u1e63a is free and pure consciousness. It is inactive, indifferent and possesses no attributes. Really speaking, it is above time and space, merit and demerit, bondage and liberation. It is only when it mistakes its reflection in the buddhi for itself and identifies itself wrongly with the internal organ\u2014the intellect, the ego and the mind, that it is said to be bound. It is the ego, and not the Puru\u1e63a, which is bound. When the Puru\u1e63a realizes its own pure nature, it gets liberated which in fact it always was. Hence bondage is due to ignorance or non-discrimination between the self and the not-self and liberation is due to right knowledge or discrimination between the self and the not-self. Liberation cannot be obtained by means of actions. Karma, good or bad or indifferent, is the function of the gu\u1e47as and leads to bondage and not to liberation. Good actions may lead to heaven and bad actions to hell but heaven and hell alike, like this worldly life, are subject to pain. It is only knowledge which leads to liberation because bondage is due to ignorance and ignorance can be removed only by knowledge.\u00b2 The J\u012bva has to realize itself as the pure Puru\u1e63a through discrimination between Puru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti. Actions and fruits, merits and demerits, pleasure and pain all belong to the not-self. The knowledge that 'I am not (the not-self)', that 'nothing is mine', that 'ego is unreal', when constantly meditated upon, becomes pure, incontrovertible and absolute and leads to liberation.\u00b3 S\u0101\u1e45khya</p> <p>\u00b9 Ibid, 56. \u00b2 j\u00f1\u0101nena ch\u0101pavargo viparyay\u0101d i\u1e63yate bandha\u1e25, Ibid, 44. \u00b3 eva\u1e41 tattv\u0101bhy\u0101s\u0101n n\u0101smi na me n\u0101ham ityapari\u015be\u1e63am. aviparyay\u0101d vi\u015buddha\u1e41 kevalam utpadyate j\u00f1\u0101nam, Ibid, 64.</p> <p>Page 164</p> <p>admits both J\u012bvanmukti and Videhamukti. The moment right knowledge dawns, the person becomes liberated here and now, even though he may be embodied due to pr\u0101rabdha karma. On account of the momentum of past deeds, the body continues to exist for some time, just as the wheel of a potter goes on revolving for some time due to previous momentum even though the potter has withdrawn his hand from it. As the liberated saint, though embodied, feels no association with the body, no new karma gets accumulated as all karma loses causal energy.\u00b9 The final and the absolute emancipation, the complete disembodied isolation automatically results after death.\u00b2 S\u0101\u1e45khya liberation is a state of complete isolation, freedom from all pain, a return of the Puru\u1e63a to its pure nature as consciousness. There is no pleasure or happiness or bliss here, for pleasure presupposes pain and is relative to it. Pleasure is the result of sattva gu\u1e47a and liberation transcends all gu\u1e47as.</p> <p>S\u0101\u1e45khya believes that bondage and liberation alike are only phenomenal. The bondage of the Puru\u1e63a is a fiction. It is only the ego, the product of Prak\u1e5bti, which is bound. And consequently it is only the ego which is liberated. Puru\u1e63a, in its complete isolation, is untouched by bondage and liberation. If Puru\u1e63a were really bound, it could not have obtained liberation even after hundred births, for real bondage can never be destroyed. It is Prak\u1e5bti which is bound and Prak\u1e5bti which is liberated. \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a frankly says: Puru\u1e63a, therefore, is really neither bound nor is it liberated nor does it transmigrate; bondage, liberation and transmigration belong to Prak\u1e5bti in its manifold forms.\u00b3 Prak\u1e5bti binds itself with its seven forms.\u2074 There is nothing finer and subtler than Prak\u1e5bti; she is so shy that she never reappears before that Puru\u1e63a who has once 'seen' her in her true colours.\u2075 Just as a dancing girl retires from the stage after entertaining the audience, similarly Prak\u1e5bti also retires after exhibiting herself to the Puru\u1e63a.\u2076</p>"},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#viii","title":"VIII","text":""},{"location":"semester-7/HS-467/Sorce%20Material/08%20Sankhya%20Material/#god","title":"GOD","text":"<p>THE original S\u0101\u1e45khya was monistic and theistic.

Either God is unjust and cruel or He is not free and all-powerful. If He is determined by the law of Karma, He is not free; if not, He is a tyrant. Again, God being pure knowledge, this material world cannot spring from Him. The effects are implicitly contained in their cause and the material world which is subject to change requires an unintelligent and ever-changing cause and not a spiritual and immutable God. Again, the eternal existence of the Puru\u1e63as is inconsistent with God. If they are the parts of God, they must have some divine power. If they are created by God, they are subject to destruction.

The logic of the S\u0101\u1e45khya system, like that of Jainism, impels it to embrace idealistic monism or absolutism but it clings, like Jainism, to spiritualistic pluralism and dualistic realism. The fundamental blunder of S\u0101\u1e45khya is to treat Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a as absolutely separate and independent realities. The Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a of S\u0101\u1e45khya thus become mere abstractions torn away from the context of concrete experience. The object and the subject are relative and not independent and absolute. Experience always unfolds them together. Like the two sides of the same coin, they are the two aspects of the same reality. To dig a chasm between them is to undermine them both. And that is what S\u0101\u1e45khya has done. The logic of S\u0101\u1e45khya requires it to maintain the ultimate reality of the transcendental Puru\u1e63a alone and to regard Prak\u1e5bti as its inseparable power. When this Puru\u1e63a is reflected in its own power Prak\u1e5bti, it becomes the empirical ego, the J\u012bva, the phenomenal. Plurality belongs to this J\u012bva, not to the transcendental Puru\u1e63a. The subject and the object, the J\u012bva and the Prak\u1e5bti, are the two aspects of the Puru\u1e63a which is their transcendental background. It is the Puru\u1e63a which sustains the empirical dualism between Prak\u1e5bti and J\u012bva and which finally transcends it. Every J\u012bva is the potential Puru\u1e63a and liberation consists in the actualization of this potentiality. This is the philosophy to which the S\u0101\u1e45khya logic points and which is throughout implicit in S\u0101\u1e45khya, but which is explicitly rejected by S\u0101\u1e45khya with the inevitable and unfortunate result that S\u0101\u1e45khya has reduced itself to a bundle of contradictions. If Prak\u1e5bti and Puru\u1e63a are absolute and independent, they can never come into contact and hence there can be no evolution at all.
