## Atomic Bonding in Solids

The properties of a material are directly related to the types of bonds that exist between its atoms.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
???+ example "Example: Ionic vs. Covalent"
    **Ionic bonds**, like in NaCl, involve the transfer of electrons, resulting in strong electrostatic attraction. Materials are typically hard and brittle.

    **Covalent bonds**, like in Diamond, involve the sharing of electrons, leading to very strong, directional bonds.
