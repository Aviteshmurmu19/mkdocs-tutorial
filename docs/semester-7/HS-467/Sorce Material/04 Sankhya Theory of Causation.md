# 04 | The Sānkhya System Theory of Causation

It is a very old and important philosophy. The founder of this philosophy is Kapila, and Sānkhya is a very old system. After Kapila came his disciple Asuri, and Asuri’s disciple is Panchasikha, then comes Isvara Krishna’s _Samkhyakarika_.

- The Mahabharata says there is no knowledge like Sānkhya.
- It is very close to Vedānta; this doctrine stands near to Vedānta since, like the latter, it admits no difference between cause and effect.

Both Sānkhya and Vedānta hold the same view of **satkāryavāda**.

- There is a similar word in Sanskrit which is _Sankhyā_.
- Another meaning is "Knowledge"—perfect knowledge, divine knowledge.
- Knowledge of the self through right discrimination (between Prakṛti and Puruṣa).
- In the Chāndogya Upanishad, the three guṇas are found, and the Sānkhya categories are mentioned in the Kaṭha Upanishad and Śvetāśvatara Upanishad.
- Pradhāna, Prakṛti, and Guṇas are also found there.

## Sānkhya System Overview

- The Sānkhya system is the work of Kapila.
- The primary text is the _Sāṅkhya-sūtra_ of Kapila.
- This system is sometimes described as ‘atheistic Sānkhya’.
- Some of the important works in the Sānkhya tradition are:
  - **Īśvarakṛṣṇa:** _Sāṅkhya-kārikā_
  - **Gauḍapāda:** _Sāṅkhya-kārikā-bhāṣya_
  - **Vācaspati:** _Tattvakaumudī_
  - **Vijñānabhikṣu:** _Sāṅkhya-pravacana-bhāṣya_ & _Sāṅkhya-sāra_
  - **Aniruddha:** _Sāṅkhya-pravacana-sūtra-vṛtti_
- The name **Sānkhya** comes from _Sankhyā_, which means enumeration.
- It aims at the right knowledge of reality by the enumeration of the ultimate objects of knowledge.
- Sānkhya admits two kinds of ultimate realities: **Spirit (puruṣa)** and **matter (prakṛti)**.

## Sānkhya Metaphysics

### Theory of Causation: Satkārya-vāda

Sānkhya metaphysics, particularly its doctrine of _prakṛti_, rests on its theory of causation. The central question is: **Does an effect originally exist in its material cause prior to its production?**

- **Buddha and Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas** answer this question negatively.
- They argue that the effect cannot be said to exist before its production by some cause.
- If the effect already existed in the material cause, there would be no sense in speaking of it being "caused" or "produced."
- If the pot already existed in the clay, why should the potter exert himself to produce it?

If the effect were already in its material cause, it would logically follow that:

- The effect is indistinguishable from the cause.
- We should use the same name for both the pot and the clay.
- The same purpose would be served by a pot and a lump of clay.

This theory, that the effect does not exist in the material cause prior to its production, is known as **asatkārya-vāda**. It is also called **ārambhavāda** (the theory of the beginning of a new effect).

### Sānkhya's Theory: Satkāryavāda

Sānkhya establishes their theory known as **satkāryavāda**.

- **Sat** means true, pure being. **Kārya** is the effect.
- **Satkāryavāda** says that something that exists cannot originate from non-existence.
- It is a theory about the relation of an effect to its material cause.
  - Example: When a potter makes a pot, clay is the material cause, and the pot is the effect.

The theory of causation in Sānkhya agrees with Vedānta. The core questions are:

- What is the relation between the thread and the cloth?
- Did this house exist in the wood before its production?
- Did this cloth exist in the thread before its production?

The whole philosophy of Sānkhya rests on the answer to this question.

- **Satkāryavādins** believe that the effect is not a new creation but only an explicit manifestation of that which was implicitly contained in its material cause.
- A key question then becomes: Is the effect a **real transformation** or an **unreal appearance** of its cause?
  - Those who believe the effect is a real transformation are called **Pariṇāmavādins**.
    - Sānkhya, Yoga, and Rāmānuja believe in **pariṇāmavāda**.
    - The view of Sānkhya and Yoga is called **Prakṛti-pariṇāma-vāda**.
    - Rāmānuja’s view is called **Brahma-pariṇāma-vāda**.
  - Those who believe it is an unreal appearance are called **Vivartavādins**.
    - Śūnyavāda, Vijñānavāda, and Śaṅkara believe in **vivartavāda**.

Sānkhya believes in **Satkāryavāda**. All material effects are modifications of _Prakṛti_. They pre-exist in the eternal bosom of _Prakṛti_.

### Arguments for Satkāryavāda

1.  **If the effect were non-existent in the material cause, no amount of effort could bring it into existence.**

    - If the pot is non-existent in the clay, then no amount of effort could create it.
    - You cannot convert salt into sugar, because sugar is not implicitly present in salt.
    - The activity of the efficient cause (like the potter) is necessary only to _manifest_ the effect that is already present in the cause (clay).
    - When we plant a seed, a tree comes out of it. This happens because the tree pre-existed in the seed.
    - If the effect does not pre-exist, it is a non-entity, like a "hare’s horn" or a "sky-flower."
    - The effect is manifested under favorable conditions, just as oil is produced by pressing oil seeds.

2.  **The effect is invariably connected with its material cause.**

    - A material cause can only produce an effect with which it is causally related. It cannot produce something unrelated to it.
    - Therefore, the effect must exist in the material cause before it is produced.
    - There is an invariable relation between a cause and its effect. An effect can only be produced by a cause to which it is related.
    - But something cannot be related to something that does not exist at all.
    - If the pot did not exist in the clay, how could the clay be related to the pot?

3.  **Everything cannot be produced out of everything.**

    - This suggests that the effect, before its manifestation, is implicit in its material cause.
    - We see that only certain effects can be produced from certain causes.
    - You cannot make a cord from honey. If this were not true, any effect could be produced from any cause. The pot does not exist in milk, only in clay.

4.  **Only an efficient cause can produce that which is potent.**

    - We see that only certain effects can be produced from certain causes (e.g., curd from milk, cloth from threads). This shows that the effect somehow exists in the cause.
    - If the effect were non-existent in the cause, then producing it would mean creating something from nothing.
    - If you see a tree, there must have been a seed. If the tree didn’t exist in the seed, we would have to say the tree came out of nothing, which is absurd.

5.  **The effect is the essence of its material cause and, as such, is identical with it.**

    - When obstructions to manifestation are removed, the effect "flows out" of its cause.
    - The cause and the effect are simply the implicit and explicit stages of the same process.
    - The cloth is contained in the threads, oil in the oil seeds, and curd in the milk.

6.  **The effect is not different from, but essentially identical to, the material cause.**
    - If the cause exists, the effect must also exist.
    - The effect and the cause are the explicit and implicit states of the same substance. A cloth is not really different from the threads of which it is made.

### Conclusion and Sub-theories

We can conclude that the effect exists in the material cause even before its production.

**Satkārya-vāda** has two main sub-theories:

1.  **Pariṇāma-vāda:** When an effect is produced, there is a **real transformation** of the cause into the effect.

    - Example: The production of a pot from clay or of curd from milk.

2.  **Vivarta-vāda** (held by Advaita Vedāntins):
    - Holds that the change of the cause into the effect is merely **apparent**.
    - Example: When we see a snake in a rope, the rope is not really transformed into a snake. It only _appears_ as a snake but is not really one.
