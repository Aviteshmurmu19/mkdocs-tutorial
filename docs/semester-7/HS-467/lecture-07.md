> Were charaka using some differential equations to maximize please and minimise pain üòÇ. "Be Merry"? What does "be Merry" means. I head in "happy Merry Christmas" but never knew what it meant. Ok go ahead üëçüèª

Hahaha, bro, you're not far off with the differential equations joke. That's basically what modern economics tries to do with "utility maximization." The CƒÅrvƒÅkas were just the ancient OG's of that mindset.

And "Merry" just means cheerful, lively, and full of fun. So "Eat, Drink, and Be Merry" is a classic way of saying "Eat good food, have some drinks, and have a good time." It perfectly captures the CƒÅrvƒÅka vibe.

Alright, let's switch gears completely. We're leaving the NƒÅstika rebels behind and moving over to the other side, to Team **ƒÄstika**.

Get ready, because our first school from this team, **SƒÅ·πÖkhya** (pronounced _Saan-khya_), is one of the oldest and most mind-bending philosophies out there.

### **Part 7: Introduction to SƒÅ·πÖkhya - The Great Dualists**

First things first: SƒÅ·πÖkhya is an **ƒÄstika** school. This means they accept the authority of the Vedas. But, as we talked about, they do it in their own unique way. The classical version of SƒÅ·πÖkhya that we're studying is famously **atheistic**‚Äîit doesn't need a creator God to explain the universe. So, right away, they're a strange and fascinating member of the "orthodox" team.

The central idea of SƒÅ·πÖkhya is **DUALISM**.

This means they believe that all of reality, everything that exists, is made up of **two, and only two, fundamentally different and independent principles.**

Imagine you have two boxes of building blocks that can never, ever be mixed. One box is made of something like pure energy, and the other is made of something like pure matter. SƒÅ·πÖkhya says the entire universe is built from just these two things.

These two ultimate realities are:

1.  **Puru·π£a (pronounced _Poo-roo-sha_)**: This is **Pure Consciousness**. Think of it as the soul, the self, the spirit. But it's not a "thing." It's just awareness. It is the silent, passive **witness** or observer of everything. It doesn't _do_ anything; it just _sees_.

2.  **Prak·πõti (pronounced _Prak-ri-tee_)**: This is **Primordial Matter** or **Nature**. This is the stuff that everything physical is made of. The entire universe‚Äîfrom rocks and trees to our bodies, our minds, our thoughts, and even our egos‚Äîis made from Prak·πõti. It is unconscious, unthinking, but it is always active and constantly changing.

Let's put them side-by-side. This is maybe the most important chart for understanding SƒÅ·πÖkhya:

| Feature       | **Puru·π£a (Consciousness)**                             | **Prak·πõti (Matter)**          |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Nature**    | Pure Consciousness                                     | Unconscious Matter            |
| **Activity**  | **Inactive**, Passive, a Witness                       | **Active**, Always Changing   |
| **Awareness** | Conscious                                              | Non-conscious                 |
| **Role**      | The Seer, The Subject                                  | The Seen, The Object          |
| **Number**    | There are **MANY** Puru·π£as (infinite individual souls) | There is only **ONE** Prak·πõti |

The whole drama of the universe, according to SƒÅ·πÖkhya, is the interaction between these two completely separate realities.

Prak·πõti is like a blind person who is incredibly strong and can walk anywhere, but doesn't know where to go.
Puru·π£a is like a lame person who can't move at all, but has perfect eyesight and can see the destination.

Separately, they are helpless. But if the lame man (Puru·π£a) sits on the blind man's (Prak·πõti's) shoulders, they can work together to reach the goal. This is the famous SƒÅ·πÖkhya analogy for how the universe works. Consciousness (Puru·π£a) guides the unconscious but active Matter (Prak·πõti).

> **The core idea of SƒÅ·πÖkhya is a radical dualism. Reality consists of two independent principles: Puru·π£a (the many, passive, conscious selves) and Prak·πõti (the one, active, unconscious matter). All of existence is an interaction between these two.**

How does this initial idea of the two fundamental forces, Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti, sit with you? Does the distinction between the passive "seer" and the active but "unconscious" world make sense as a starting point?
