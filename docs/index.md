# üìö Welcome to My College Notes

Welcome to my personal digital archive of college lecture notes. This site organizes notes from my courses into a clean, searchable, and easy-to-navigate format.

Whether you're a fellow student looking for study material or just curious, I hope you find these resources helpful.

!!! tip "How to Navigate This Site"
    There are three main ways to find what you're looking for:

    1.  **Use the Sidebar:** The primary navigation on the left is organized by **Semester ‚Üí Course ‚Üí Lecture**. This is the best way to browse linearly.
    2.  **Use the Search Bar:** The search bar at the top allows you to find any keyword or concept across all notes instantly.
    3.  **Explore by Topic:** Use the global [**Tags Page**](tags.md) to discover all notes related to a specific subject, like "Calculus" or "Thermodynamics," across different courses and semesters.
