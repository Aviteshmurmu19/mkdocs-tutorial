<p>is the unique Gateway to Bliss and which frightens the wrong doctrines. One who has realized this truth cannot be tainted with any defect, for defect and truth, like darkness and light, are opposed to each other. And when there is no defect and no attachment, all 'coverings' of ignorance are removed and consequently Omniscience is realized and Oneness with the Buddha is attained.¬π When the truth that Consciousness is the only reality and that ultimately there is no object (dharma-nairƒÅtmya) and no subject (pudgala-nairƒÅtmya) is realized, the cycle of birth-and-death comes to a standstill. This state is called Apavarga.¬≤</p>
<p>The Merciful Buddha who is the true friend of all, has taught the right doctrine to everybody without making any distinction of any kind.¬≥ The wise BrƒÅhma·πáas pay their respects to the Omniscient Buddha.‚Å¥ The real BrƒÅhma·πáas are those who have removed all the sins by practising the teaching of NairƒÅtmya and they are to be found in the religion founded by the Enlightened Sage.‚Åµ The spurious BrƒÅhmanas, unable to defend their wrong views by means of sound arguments fall back upon the authority of the Veda. The Great Buddha, on the other hand, confident of his power to expound the right doctrine through reasonable arguments, curbing the arrogance of the maddened elephant-like opponents, fearlessly roars like a lion in the following manner:‚Äî'O Bhik·π£us, accept my words not out of mere respect for me, but after testing them at the touchstone of reason, just as gold is accepted as true by the wise after heating, cutting and rubbing against the touchstone'.‚Å∂</p>

<p>SƒÄNKHYA is undoubtedly one of the oldest systems of Indian Philosophy. We find references to the SƒÅ·πÖkhya-Yoga doctrines in some of the Upani·π£ads, e.g., in the ChhƒÅndogya,¬π the Pra≈õna,¬≤ the Ka·π≠ha¬≥ and particularly in the ≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara;‚Å¥ in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata;‚Åµ in the Gƒ´tƒÅ;‚Å∂ and in the Sm·πõtis and the PurƒÅ·πáas. BƒÅdarƒÅya·πáa, the author of the VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra, repeatedly refers to the view whether the SƒÅ·πÖkhya can be regarded as the teaching of the Upani·π£ads and rejects it,‚Å∑ besides undertaking refutation of the SƒÅ·πÖkhya in the TarkapƒÅda on rational grounds. ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅchƒÅrya regards it as the 'main opponent' (pradhƒÅna-malla) of VedƒÅnta and says that though SƒÅ·πÖkhya and Yoga are generally accepted by the wise as conducive to the Highest Good, yet these systems advocate dualism and cannot be supported by the ≈öruti. These words are used in the ≈öruti and the Sm·πõti in the sense of knowledge and action respectively and words like Mahat, Avyakta etc. are used in the sense of names and forms.‚Å∏ The fact that BƒÅdarƒÅya·πáa and ≈öa·πÖkara are keen to reject the view that SƒÅ·πÖkhya, though accepted by the wise, is not based on the Upani·π£ads because it advocates dualism, suggests that there must have been some thinkers belonging to the SƒÅ·πÖkhya who claimed it to be the teaching of the Upani·π£ads. Though nothing can be said with absolute certainty, it seems highly probable that the SƒÅ·πÖkhya in the beginning was based on the Upani·π£ads and had accepted the theistic Absolute, but later on, under the influence of the Jaina and the Buddhist thought, it rejected theistic monism and was content with spiritualistic pluralism and atheistic realism. And it is this SƒÅnkhya to which BƒÅdarƒÅya·πáa and ≈öa·πÖkara are opposed. This also explains why some of the later SƒÅ·πÖkhyas, e.g. Vij√±ƒÅnabhik·π£u in the sixteenth century, tried to revive the earlier theism in SƒÅ·πÖkhya.</p>
<p>Tradition regards Kapila as the founder of this system. But SƒÅ·πÖkhya-pravachana-s≈´tra which is attributed to him is generally regarded by</p>

<p>scholars as a work of the fourteenth century A.D., because it has been referred to by the earlier writers of the other schools, because it criticizes the rival systems and because it wants to revive theism. So far as theism is concerned, we maintain that the original SƒÅ·πÖkhya was theistic. But the fact that this work has been ignored and ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa's KƒÅrikƒÅ has been referred to instead by the other earlier writers as well as the fact that it criticizes other systems go against this view. But being regarded as that of Kapila himself, as ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa himself speaks of Kapila, ƒÄsuri, and Pa√±cha≈õikha, it seems probable that these were historical personages whose works have been lost. Kapila certainly flourished before Buddha and he must have composed SƒÅ·πÖkhya-s≈´tra which work was unfortunately lost long ago. ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa's SƒÅ·πÖkhya-KƒÅrikƒÅ seems to be the earliest available and the most popular work of this system. Besides this we have Gau·∏çapƒÅda's SƒÅ·πÖkhya-KƒÅrikƒÅ-bhƒÅ·π£ya, VƒÅchaspati Mi≈õra's Tattva-Kaumudƒ´ and Vij√±ƒÅna-bhik·π£u's SƒÅ·πÖkhya-pravachana-bhƒÅ·π£ya.</p>
<p>The word 'SƒÅ·πÖkhya' is derived from the word 'sa·πÖkhyƒÅ' which means right knowledge as well as number. The Gƒ´tƒÅ uses this word in the sense of knowledge, so does the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata at other places. Also SƒÅ·πÖkhya means the philosophy of right knowledge (samyak khyƒÅti or j√±ƒÅna). The system is predominantly intellectual and theoretical. Right knowledge is the knowledge of the separateness of the Puru·π£a from the Prak·πõti. Yoga, as the counterpart of SƒÅ·πÖkhya, means action or practice and tells us how the theoretical metaphysical teachings of SƒÅ·πÖkhya might be realized in actual practice. Thus SƒÅ·πÖkhya-Yoga forms one complete system, the former being the theoretical while the latter being the practical aspect of the same teaching. SƒÅ·πÖkhya is also the philosophy of numbers, because it deals with twenty-five categories. As a philosophy of numbers, it might have influenced the Pythagorean philosophy.</p>
<p>ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa (fifth century A.D.) is the representative of the classical SƒÅ·πÖkhya which had divorced itself from the Upani·π£ads under the influence of Jainism and Buddhism, yet the VedƒÅntic teaching of absolutism with which the original SƒÅ·πÖkhya was associated, asserts itself implicitly in ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa. We have seen that absolutism is implicit in Jainism and explicit in MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and we shall see how it is implicit in ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa also.</p>
<p>SƒÅ·πÖkhya maintains a clear-cut dualism between Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti and further maintains the plurality of the Puru·π£as, and is silent on God. It is a pluralistic spiritualism and an atheistic realism and an uncompromising dualism.</p>

<h4 id="theory-of-causation">THEORY OF CAUSATION<a class="headerlink" href="#theory-of-causation" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>LET us first consider the SƒÅ·πÖkhya theory of causation on which its doctrine of Prak·πõti is based. The basic question involved in any theory of causation is: Does the effect pre-exist in its material cause? Those who answer this question in the negative are called AsatkƒÅryavƒÅdins, while those who answer it in the affirmative are called SatkƒÅryavƒÅdins. According to the former, the effect is a new creation, a real beginning. The effect (<em>kƒÅrya</em>) does not pre-exist (<em>asat</em>) in its material cause. Otherwise, there would be no sense in saying that it is produced or caused. If the pot already exists in the clay and the cloth in the threads and curd in milk, then why should the potter exert himself in producing the pot out of the clay, and why should not the threads serve the purpose of the cloth and why should not milk taste like curd? Moreover, its production would be its repeated birth which is nonsense. NyƒÅya, Vai≈õe·π£ika, Hƒ´nayƒÅna Buddhism, Materialism and some followers of Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ believe in AsatkƒÅryavƒÅda, which is also known as ƒÄrambhavƒÅda, i.e., the view that production is a new beginning. Materialism believes in SvabhƒÅvavƒÅda; Hƒ´nayƒÅna Buddhism in Anitya-paramƒÅ·πáuvƒÅda or K·π£a·πáabha·πÖgavƒÅda and NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika and some followers of Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ in Nitya-parƒÅmƒÅ·πáu-kƒÅra·πáavƒÅda. The SatkƒÅryavƒÅdins, on the other hand, believe that the effect is not a new creation, but only an explicit manifestation of that which was implicitly contained in its material cause. Here, another important question arises: Is the effect a real transformation or an unreal appearance of its cause? Those who believe that the effect is a real transformation of its cause are called Pari·πáƒÅmavƒÅdins (<em>pari·πáƒÅma</em> = real modification); while those who believe that it is an unreal appearance are called VivartavƒÅdins (<em>vivarta</em> = unreal appearance). SƒÅ·πÖkhya, Yoga and RƒÅmƒÅnuja believe in Pari·πáƒÅmavƒÅda. The view of SƒÅ·πÖkhya-Yoga is called Prak·πõti-pari·πáƒÅma-vƒÅda, while the view of RƒÅmƒÅnuja is called Brahma-pari·πáƒÅmavƒÅda. ≈ö≈´nyavƒÅda, Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda and ≈öa·πÖkara believe in VivartavƒÅda. Their views may be respectively called ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ-vivarta-vƒÅdƒÅ, Vij√±ƒÅna-vivarta-vƒÅda and Brahma-vivarta-vƒÅda. The view of Jainism and of KumƒÅrila may be called SadasatkƒÅryavƒÅda because according to them the effect is both real as well as unreal before its production‚Äîreal as identical with the cause and unreal as a modal change thereof, though ultimately both incline towards Pari·πáƒÅmavƒÅda.</p>
<p>SƒÅ·πÖkhya believes in SatkƒÅryavƒÅda. All material effects are the modification (<em>pari·πáƒÅma</em>) of Prak·πõti. They pre-exist in the eternal bosom</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Page 152</strong></p>
<p>of Prak·πõti and simply come out of it at the time of creation and return to it at the time of dissolution. There is neither new production nor utter destruction. Production means development or manifestation (<em>ƒÅvir-bhƒÅva</em>); destruction means envelopment or dissolution (<em>tirobhƒÅva</em>). Production is evolution; destruction is involution. SƒÅ·πÖkhya gives five arguments in support of SatkƒÅryavƒÅda:</p>
<p>(1) If the effect does not pre-exist in its cause, it becomes a mere nonentity like the hare's horn or the sky-flower and can never be produced (asadakaranƒÅt).
(2) The effect is only a manifestation of its material cause, because it is invariably connected with it (upƒÅdƒÅnagraha·πáƒÅt).
(3) Everything cannot be produced out of everything. This suggests that the effect, before its manifestation, is implicit in its material cause (sarvasambhavƒÅbhƒÅvƒÅt).
(4) Only an efficient cause can produce that for which it is potent. This again means that the effect, before its manifestation, is potentially contained in its material cause. Production is only an actualization of the potential (≈õaktasya ≈õakya-kara·πáƒÅt). Were it not so, then curd should be produced out of water, and cloth out of reeds, and, oil out of sand-particles.
(5) The effect is the essence of its material cause and as such identical with it. When the obstructions in the way of manifestation are removed, the effect naturally flows out of its cause. The cause and the effect are the implicit and the explicit stages of the same process. The cloth is contained in the threads, the oil in the oil-seeds, the curd in the milk. The effect pre-exists in its material cause (kƒÅra·πáabhƒÅvƒÅt).¬π</p>

<p>THE theory that causation means a real transformation of the material cause leads to the concept of Prak·πõti as the root-cause of the world of objects. All worldly effects are latent in this uncaused cause, because infinite regress has to be avoided. It is the potentiality of nature, 'the receptacle and nurse of all generation'. As the uncaused root-cause, it is called Prak·πõti; as the first principle of this Universe, it is called PradhƒÅna; as the unmanifested state of all effects, it is known as Avyakta;</p>

<p>as the extremely subtle and imperceptible thing which is only inferred from its products, it is called AnumƒÅna; as the unintelligent and unconscious principle, it is called Ja·∏ça; and as the ever-active unlimited power, it is called ≈öakti. The products are caused, dependent, relative, many and temporary as they are subject to birth and death or to production and destruction; but Prak·πõti is uncaused, independent, absolute, one and eternal, being beyond production and destruction. The extreme subtleness of Prak·πõti makes it unmanifest and imperceptible; we infer its existence through its products. Motion is inherent in it in the form of Rajas. As the source of the inanimate world, it is unconscious. The entire world of objects is implicit in the bosom of Prak·πõti. Evolution is the explicit manifestation of this world of objects, while dissolution is the returning of this world to Prak·πõti. SƒÅ·πÖkhya believes that consciousness cannot be regarded as the source of the inanimate world, as VedƒÅnta and MahƒÅyƒÅna believe, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unintelligent world. On the other hand, the material atoms of the physical elements too cannot be regarded as the cause of this world, as ChƒÅrvƒÅkas, NyƒÅya and Vai≈õe·π£ika, Jainism and Hƒ´nayƒÅna Buddhism, and Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ wrongly believe, because they cannot explain the subtle products of matter like intellect, mind and ego (these are different from pure consciousness which belongs to Puru·π£a alone, and are regarded here as internal organs), and further because the unity of the universe points to a single cause while the atoms are scattered and many. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible, eternal and one Prak·πõti alone is the final source of this world of objects which is implicitly and potentially contained in its bosom.</p>
<p>SƒÅ·πÖkhya gives five proofs for the existence of Prak·πõti which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All individual things in this world are limited, dependent, conditional and finite. The finite cannot be the cause of the universe. Logically we have to proceed from the finite to the infinite, from the limited to the unlimited, from the <em>peros</em> to the <em>aperos</em>, from the temporary to the permanent, from the many to the one. And it is this infinite, unlimited, eternal and all-pervading Prak·πõti which is the source of this universe (bhedƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ parimƒÅ·πáƒÅt).
(2) All worldly things possess certain common characteristics by which they are capable of producing pleasure, pain and indifference. Hence there must be a common source composed of three Gu·πáas, from which all worldly things arise (samanvayƒÅt).
(3) All effects arise from the activity of the potent cause. Evolution means the manifestation of the hitherto implicit as the</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Page 154</strong></p>
<p>explicit. The activity which generates evolution must be inherent in the world-cause. And this cause is Prak·πõti (kƒÅryata·∏• prav·πõtte≈õcha).
(4) The effect differs from the cause and hence the limited effect cannot be regarded as its own cause. The effect is the explicit and the cause is the implicit state of the same process. The effects, therefore, point to a world-cause where they are potentially contained (kƒÅra·πáakƒÅryavibhƒÅgƒÅt).
(5) The unity of the universe points to a single cause. And this cause is Prak·πõti. (avibhƒÅgƒÅt vai≈õvar≈´pyasya).¬π</p>
<p>Prak·πõti is said to be the unity of the three Gu·πáas held in equilibrium (gu·πáƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ sƒÅmyƒÅvasthƒÅ). The three Gu·πáas are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. They are the constituents of Prak·πõti and through it of the worldly objects. Being subtle and imperceptible their existence is inferred from their effects‚Äîpleasure, pain and indifference respectively. Although they are called Gu·πáas, yet they are not ordinary qualities or attributes like the NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika Gu·πáas. They themselves possess qualities like lightness, activity, heaviness etc. They are extremely fine and ever-changing elements. They make up Prak·πõti which is nothing apart from them. They are not the qualities which Prak·πõti, the substance, possesses; on the other hand they themselves constitute Prak·πõti. They are the factors or the constituents or the elements of Prak·πõti. They are called Gu·πáas¬≤ because they are the elements of Prak·πõti which alone is called substantive; or because they are subservient to the end of the Puru·π£a, or because they are intertwined, like three strands, to make up the rope of Prak·πõti which binds the Puru·π£as.</p>
<p>Sattva literally means real or existent and is responsible for the manifestation of objects in consciousness. It is called goodness and produces pleasure. It is light and bright, buoyant (<em>laghu</em>) and illuminating (<em>prakƒÅ≈õaka</em>). Luminosity of light, power of reflection, upward movement, pleasure, happiness, contentment, bliss are all due to it. Its colour is white. Rajas, which literally means foulness, is the principle of motion. It produces pain. Restless activity, feverish effort and wild stimulation are its results. It is mobile (<em>chala</em>) and stimulating (<em>upa·π£·π≠ambhaka</em>). Its colour is red. Tamas, which literally means darkness, is the principle of inertia. It produces apathy and indifference. Ignorance, sloth, confusion, bewilderment, passivity and negativity are its results. It is heavy (<em>guru</em>) and enveloping (<em>vara·πáaka</em>) and as such is opposed to Sattva. It is also opposed to Rajas as it arrests activity. Its colour is dark. These three gu·πáas which constitute Prak·πõti are never separate. They</p>

<p>conflict and yet co-operate with one another and are always found intermingled. They are compared to the oil, the wick and the flame of a lamp, which, though opposed, yet co-operate to produce the light of a lamp. They are imperceptible and are inferred from their effects. All things are composed of these three gu·πáas and their differences are due to the different combinations of these gu·πáas. The nature of a thing is determined by the preponderance of a particular gu·πáa. Things are called good, bad or indifferent; intelligent, active or slothful; pure, impure or neutral, on account of the predominance of sattva, rajas or tamas respectively. When these gu·πáas are held in a state of equilibrium, that state is called Prak·πõti. Evolution of worldly objects does not take place at this state. These gu·πáas are said to be ever-changing. They cannot remain static even for a moment. Change is said to be of two kinds‚Äîhomogeneous or <em>sar≈´pa-pari·πáƒÅma</em> and heterogeneous or <em>vir≈´pa-pari·πáƒÅma</em>. During the state of dissolution (<em>pralaya</em>) of the world, the gu·πáas change homogeneously, i.e., sattva changes into sattva, rajas into rajas and tamas into tamas. This change does not disturb the equilibrium of the gu·πáas and unless the equilibrium is disturbed and one predominates over the other two, evolution cannot take place. Evolution starts when there is heterogeneous change in the gu·πáas and one predominates over the other two and brings about terrific commotion in the bosom of Prak·πõti.</p>
<p>The nature of these gu·πáas is beautifully brought out in a Hindi couplet by Rasalina. The poet says that the eyes of the beloved are white, red and dark, and are full of nectar, intoxication and poison, with the result that once they pierce the heart of the lover, he experiences the joy of life, the agony of restlessness and the inertia of death. The recollection of the beloved gives him joy and makes life worth living; separation causes acute pain and makes him restless; intensity of love makes him forget everything and become inactive, unconscious and almost dead.¬π Sattva is white and is like nectar and gives joy; rajas is red and is like intoxication and gives pain; tamas is dark and is like poison and produces unconsciousness. 'We bow to Prak·πõti,' says ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa, 'the red-white-dark, the unborn mother and ‚Äúnurse and receptacle of all generation‚Äù.'¬≤ Such is the conception of Prak·πõti in SƒÅ·πÖkhya.</p>

<p>THE other of the two co-present co-eternal realities of SƒÅ·πÖkhya is the Puru·π£a, the principal of pure Consciousness. Puru·π£a is the soul, the self, the spirit, the subject, the knower. It is neither body nor senses nor</p>

<p>brain nor mind (<em>manas</em>) nor ego (<em>aha·πÖkƒÅra</em>) nor intellect (<em>buddhi</em>). It is not a substance which possesses the quality of Consciousness. Consciousness is its essence. It is itself pure and transcendental Consciousness. It is the ultimate knower which is the foundation of all knowledge. It is the pure subject and as such can never become an object of knowledge. It is the silent witness, the emancipated alone, the neutral seer, the peaceful eternal. It is beyond time and space, beyond change and activity. It is self-luminous and self-proved. It is uncaused, eternal and all-pervading. It is the indubitable real, the postulate of knowledge, and all doubts and denials pre-suppose its existence. It is called <em>nistraigu·πáya</em>, <em>udƒÅsƒ´nƒÅ</em>, <em>akartƒÅ</em>, <em>kevala</em>, <em>madhyastha</em>, <em>sƒÅk·π£ƒ´</em>, <em>dra·π£·π≠ƒÅ</em>, <em>sadƒÅprakƒÅ≈õasvar≈´pa</em>, and <em>j√±ƒÅta</em>.¬π</p>
<p>SƒÅ·πÖkhya gives the following five proofs for the existence of the Puru·π£a:</p>
<p>(1) All compound objects exist for the sake of the Puru·π£a. The body, the senses, the mind and the intellect are all means to realize the end of the Puru·π£a. The three gu·πáas, the Prak·πõti, the subtle body‚Äîall are said to serve the purpose of the self. Evolution is teleological or purposive. Prak·πõti evolves itself in order to serve the Puru·π£a's end. This proof is teleological (sa·πÖghƒÅtaparƒÅrthatvƒÅt).
(2) All objects are composed of the three gu·πáas and therefore logically presuppose the existence of the Puru·π£a who is the witness of these gu·πáas and is himself beyond them. The three gu·πáas imply the conception of a <em>nistraigu·πáya</em>‚Äîthat which is beyond them. This proof is logical (trigu·πáƒÅdiviparyayƒÅt).
(3) There must be a transcendental synthetic unity of pure Consciousness to co-ordinate all experiences. All knowledge necessarily presupposes the existence of the self. The self is the foundation (adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna), the fundamental postulate of all empirical knowledge. All affirmations and all negations equally presuppose it. Without it, experience would not become experience. This proof is ontological (adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅnƒÅt).
(4) Non-intelligent Prak·πõti cannot experience its products. So there must be an intelligent principle to experience the worldly products of Prak·πõti. Prak·πõti is the enjoyed (<em>bhogyƒÅ</em>) and so there must be an enjoyer (<em>bhoktƒÅ</em>). All objects of the world have the characteristics of producing pleasure, pain and bewilderment. But pleasure, pain and bewilderment have meaning only when there is a conscious principle to</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Page 157</strong></p>
<p>experience them. Hence Puru·π£a must exist. This argument is ethical (bhokt·πõbhƒÅvƒÅt).
(5) There are persons who try to attain release from the sufferings of the world. The desire for liberation and emancipation implies the existence of a person who can try for and obtain liberation. Aspiration presupposes the aspirant. This proof is mystical or religious (kaivalyƒÅrtham prav·πõtte·∏•).¬≤</p>
<p>Unlike Advaita VedƒÅnta and like Jainism and Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ, SƒÅ·πÖkhya believes in the plurality of the Puru·π£as. Like the Jƒ´vas of the Jainas, the souls of RƒÅmƒÅnuja and the monads of Leibnitz, the SƒÅ·πÖkhya Puru·π£as are subject to qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism. The selves are all essentially alike; only numerically are they different. Their essence is consciousness. Bliss is regarded as different from consciousness and is the product of the sattvagu·πáa. SƒÅ·πÖkhya gives the following three arguments for proving the plurality of the Puru·π£as:</p>
<p>(i) The souls have different sensory and motor organs and undergo separate births and deaths. Had there been only one Puru·π£a, the birth or death of one should have meant the birth or death of all and any particular experience of pleasure, pain or indifference by one should have been equally shared by all. Hence the souls must be many.
(ii) If the self were one, bondage of one should have meant bondage of all and liberation of one should have meant liberation of all. The activity of one should have made all persons active and the sleep of one should have lulled into sleep all other persons.
(iii) Though the emancipated souls are all alike and differ only in number as they are all beyond the three gu·πáas, yet the bound souls relatively differ in qualities also, since in some sattva predominates, while in others rajas, and in still others tamas. Hence their difference.</p>

<p>We have seen that Prak·πõti is regarded as essentially dynamic. If motion were not inherent in Prak·πõti, it could not be given to it by any outside agency; and if motion once ceased in Prak·πõti, it could not reappear. Hence Prak·πõti is always changing.¬≥ Even in dissolution, there is</p>

<p>homogeneous change (<em>sar≈´pa</em> or <em>sajƒÅtƒ´ya pari·πáƒÅma</em>) in Prak·πõti when all the three gu·πáas are in the state of equilibrium. It is only when heterogeneous change takes place and rajas vibrates and makes sattva and tamas vibrate that the equilibrium is disturbed and evolution takes place. Sattva, the principle of manifestation and rajas, the principle of activity were formerly held in check by tamas, the principle of non-manifestation and non-activity. But when rajas, the principle of activity vibrates and makes the other two vibrate, the process of creation begins. And creation is not the new creation of the worldly objects, but only their manifestation. It is only making explicit of that which was formerly implicit. Evolution is regarded as cyclic and not linear. There is no continuous progress in one direction, but alternating periods of evolution (<em>sarga</em>) and dissolution (<em>pralaya</em>) in a cyclic order. Evolution is again said to be teleological and not mechanical or blind. Evolution takes place for serving the purpose of the Puru·π£a. Prak·πõti, the gu·πáas, the senses, the mind, the ego, the intellect, the subtle body‚Äîall are constantly serving the end of the Puru·π£a. This end is either worldly experience (<em>bhoga</em>) or liberation (<em>apavarga</em>). Puru·π£a needs Prak·πõti for enjoyment as well as for liberation, for <em>sa·πÅsƒÅra</em> as well as for Kaivalya. Evolution supplies objects to be enjoyed to the Puru·π£a and also works for his liberation by enabling him to discriminate between himself and Prak·πõti.</p>
<p>Now the question is: How does evolution take place? Evidently when heterogeneous motion arises and rajas disturbs the equilibrium of the gu·πáas. But how is the equilibrium disturbed? SƒÅ·πÖkhya fails to answer this question satisfactorily. The fundamental blunder of SƒÅ·πÖkhya has been to separate Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a as absolute and independent entities. As a matter of fact, the subject and the object are two aspects of the same reality which holds them together and yet transcends them. All realistic pluralism, of whatever brand it may be, has failed to answer this question satisfactorily. If Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a are absolutely separate and independent entities, then they can never unite together, nor can there be any <em>tertium quid</em> to unite them. And if they cannot unite evolution cannot take place. SƒÅ·πÖkhya says that the disturbance of the equilibrium of the gu·πáas which starts evolution is made possible by the contact of Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti. Puru·π£a without Prak·πõti is lame and Prak·πõti without Puru·π£a is blind. 'Theory without practice is empty and practice without theory is blind.' 'Concepts without percepts are empty and percepts without concepts are blind.' Prak·πõti needs Puru·π£a in order to be known, to be seen, to be enjoyed (dar≈õanƒÅrtham); and Puru·π£a needs Prak·πõti in order to enjoy (<em>bhoga</em>) and also in order to obtain liberation (<em>apavarga</em>), in order to discriminate between himself and Prak·πõti and thereby obtain emancipation (<em>kaivalyƒÅrtham</em>). If Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a remain separate, there is dissolution. For creation they must unite. Just as a lame man</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Page 159</strong></p>
<p>and a blind man can co-operate and the lame may sit on the shoulders of the blind and point to him the way, while the blind may walk and thus both can reach the destination, though neither of them could have done that separately, similarly the inactive Puru·π£a and the non-intelligent Prak·πõti co-operate to serve the end, and this union disturbs the equilibrium of the gu·πáas and leads to evolution.¬π But how can the two opposed and independent entities really come into contact? SƒÅ·πÖkhya realizes this difficulty and in order to avoid it says that there is no real contact between Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti and that only the proximity of the Puru·π£a, only the fact that Puru·π£a is near to Prak·πõti (<em>puru·π£a-sannidhi-mƒÅtra</em>), is sufficient to disturb the equilibrium of the gu·πáas and thus lead to evolution. But here SƒÅ·πÖkhya falls into another difficulty. The Puru·π£a being always near to Prak·πõti (for the inactive Puru·π£a cannot move), evolution should never stop and dissolution would become impossible. Evolution, then, would be beginningless and the very conception of Prak·πõti as the state of equilibrium of the three gu·πáas would be impossible. SƒÅ·πÖkhya finds itself between these two horns of a dilemma‚Äîeither no contact and hence no evolution or else no equilibrium and hence no Prak·πõti and no dissolution. In order to avoid these difficulties, SƒÅ·πÖkhya now posits the theory of the semblance of a contact (<em>sa·πÅyogƒÅbhƒÅsa</em>). Of course, there is no real contact (<em>sa·πÅyoga</em>) between Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti; there is the semblance of a contact and it is this semblance which leads to evolution. Puru·π£a is reflected in the intellect (<em>buddhi</em>) and wrongly identifies himself with his own reflection in the buddhi. It is this reflection of the Puru·π£a which comes into contact with Prak·πõti and not the Puru·π£a himself. But buddhi or mahat is regarded as the first evolute of Prak·πõti and how can it arise before evolution to receive the reflection of the Puru·π£a? To avoid this difficulty it is said that the Puru·π£a is reflected in the Prak·πõti itself. If so, then liberation and dissolution would become impossible because Prak·πõti being always there and it being the essential nature of the Puru·π£a to identify himself with his reflection in the Prak·πõti, he would never get liberation and the very purpose for which evolution starts would get defeated. Moreover, the reflection being always there, there would be no dissolution and so no equilibrium of the gu·πáas and hence no Prak·πõti. Again, if semblance of a contact is sufficient to disturb the equilibrium, then evolution itself becomes a semblance of evolution, an appearance only (<em>vivarta</em>) and no real transformation (<em>pari·πáƒÅma</em>) of Prak·πõti. Thus we see that in order to defend the initial blunder of regarding Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti as absolute and independent entities, SƒÅ·πÖkhya commits blunders after blunders.</p>

<p>THE first product of the evolution is called Mahat, the Great. It is the germ of this vast world of objects including intellect, ego and mind. It is cosmic in its nature. But it has a psychological aspect also in which it is called buddhi or intellect. Buddhi is distinguished from consciousness. Puru·π£a alone is pure consciousness. Buddhi or intellect, being the evolute of Prak·πõti, is material. It is made of finest matter and is thus capable of reflecting clearly the consciousness of the Puru·π£a, like a wireless set capable of receiving the aerial waves. On account of the reflection of the Puru·π£a in it, it becomes apparently conscious and intelligent. The senses, the mind and the ego function for buddhi or intellect which functions directly for the Puru·π£a. Its functions are said to be ascertainment and decision. It arises when sattva predominates. Its original attributes are virtue (<em>dharma</em>), knowledge (<em>j√±ƒÅna</em>), detachment (<em>vairƒÅgya</em>) and power (<em>ai≈õvarya</em>). When it gets vitiated by tamas, these attributes are replaced by their opposites. Memories and recollections are stored in buddhi.</p>
<p>Mahat produces Aha·πÖkƒÅra. It is the principle of individuation. Its function is to generate self-sense (<em>abhimƒÅna</em>). It produces the notion of the 'I' and the 'mine'. It is the individual ego-sense. Puru·π£a wrongly identifies himself with this ego and knows himself as the agent of actions, desirer of desires and striver for ends, and possessor and enjoyer of ideas, emotions and volitions and also of material objects. Aha·πÖkƒÅra is said to be of three kinds:</p>
<p>(1) VaikƒÅrika or sƒÅttvika, when sattva predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it produces manas and five sensory organs and five motor organs. Viewed as psychological, it produces good deeds.
(2) Bh≈´tƒÅdi or tƒÅmasa, when tamas predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it produces the five subtle elements (tan-mƒÅtras). Viewed as psychological, it leads to indifferent acts or to idleness and sloth.
(3) Taijasa or rƒÅjasa, when rajas predominates. Viewed as cosmic, it supplies the energy by which the SƒÅttvika and the TƒÅmasa produce their respective evolutes. Viewed as psychological, it produces evil deeds.</p>
<p>Manas or mind which arises from the SƒÅttvika Aha·πÖkƒÅra is the subtle and central sense-organ. It can come into contact with the several sense-organs at the same time. According to the NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Page 161</strong></p>
<p>School, manas is eternal and atomic and cannot come into contact with several senses simultaneously. According to SƒÅ·πÖkhya, it is neither eternal nor atomic. It is made up of parts and so can come into contact with the different senses simultaneously. SƒÅ·πÖkhya assigns to manas the important function of synthesizing the sense-data into determinate perceptions, passing them on to the ego, and carrying out the orders of the ego through the motor organs.</p>
<p>The SƒÅttvika Aha·πÖkƒÅra produces, besides manas, the five sensory and the five motor organs. The five sensory organs (<em>j√±ƒÅnendriya</em>) are the functions of sight, smell, taste, touch and sound. According to the NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika, the five sensory organs are derived from the five gross physical elements. But according to the SƒÅ·πÖkhya, the five senses are the functions of the mind and are derived from Aha·πÖkƒÅra. The five motor organs (<em>karmendriya</em>) are the functions of speech, prehension, movement, excretion and reproduction.</p>
<p>Buddhi, aha·πÖkƒÅra and manas represent the three psychological aspects of knowing, willing and feeling or cognition, conation and affection respectively. SƒÅ·πÖkhya calls them material and derives them from Prak·πõti. They shine through the light of the Puru·π£a and are apparently conscious. All the three are called the internal organs or <em>anta·∏•kara·πáa</em> and vital breaths (<em>prƒÅ·πáas</em>) are said to be their modifications. The five sensory and the five motor organs together are called the ten external organs or <em>bƒÅhyakara·πáa</em>. These are the thirteen <em>kara·πáas</em> or organs of the SƒÅ·πÖkhya.</p>
<p>From the TƒÅmasa Aha·πÖkƒÅra arise the five subtle essences which are called TanmƒÅtras or 'things-in-themselves'. These are the essences of sight, smell, taste, touch and sound. Unlike the NyƒÅya-Vai≈õe·π£ika ones, they are not derived from the gross elements. Rather the gross elements themselves arise out of these. They are neither the qualities nor the differentia of the gross elements nor the functions which are the sensory organs, but the subtle essences which produce the gross elements as well as their qualities. From the essence of sound (<em>≈õabdatanmƒÅtrƒÅ</em>) arises the element of ether (<em>ƒÅkƒÅ≈õa</em>) together with the quality of sound. From the essence of touch combined with the essence of sound, arises the element of air together with the qualities of sound and touch. From the subtle essence of colour or sight combined with those of sound and touch, arises the element of fire or light together with the qualities of sound, touch and colour. From the essence of taste combined with those of sound, touch and colour, arises the element of water together with the qualities of sound, touch, colour and taste. And lastly, from the essence of smell combined with those of sound, touch, colour and taste, arises the element of earth together with the qualities of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell.</p>
<p>Evolution is the play of these twenty-four principles which, together</p>

<p>with the Puru·π£a who is a mere spectator and outside the play of evolution, are the twenty-five categories of SƒÅ·πÖkhya. Out of these twenty-five principles, the Puru·π£a is neither a cause nor an effect; Prak·πõti is only the cause and not the effect; Mahat, Aha·πÖkƒÅra and the five subtle essences are both causes and effects; while the five sensory and the five motor organs and the five gross elements and manas are effects only.¬π This may be depicted by the following table:</p>

<p>The evolution is teleological. Everything works to serve the purpose of the Puru·π£a though unconsciously. Just as non-intelligent trees grow fruits, or water flows on account of the declivity of the soil, or iron-filings are attracted towards a magnet, or milk flows through the udders of the cow in order to nourish the calf, similarly everything unconsciously tends to serve the purpose of the Puru·π£a, whether it is enjoyment or liberation.¬≤ Prak·πõti is the benefactress of Puru·π£a. Though Puru·π£a is inactive and indifferent and devoid of qualities, yet the virtuous and the generous Prak·πõti which is full of qualities and goodness ceaselessly works through various means in a spirit of detachment for the realization of the Puru·π£a, without any benefit to herself.¬≥ Prak·πõti works to liberate the Puru·π£a.‚Å¥ There is immanent teleology in Prak·πõti. Though Puru·π£a is neither a cause nor an effect, yet relatively it is he who should be regarded as the efficient cause as well as the final cause of evolution though SƒÅ·πÖkhya regards Prak·πõti as both the material and the efficient cause. He is like Aristotle's God, the unmoved mover who is beyond evolution. God, the pure intelligence, like the Puru·π£a, does not actively participate in evolution. He is the end towards which the creation moves. And the creation moves by His mere presence. The gu·πáas, which mutually differ and yet always co-operate, work like the oil, wick and flame of a lamp and illuminate the entire purpose of the Puru·π£a and present it to the buddhi or the intellect.‚Åµ All the organs work for the realization of the Puru·π£a's end and for no other end.‚Å∂ The subtle body too works for the sake of the Puru·π£a's end.‚Å∑ Thus the whole creation unconsciously tends</p>

<p>towards the realization of the purpose of the Puru·π£a. And creation will continue till all the Puru·π£as are liberated. The entire evolution of Prak·πõti, therefore, right from the first evolute, the Mahat, up to the last evolutes, the gross elements, is for the purpose of liberating each individual Puru·π£a.¬π</p>

<p>THE earthly life is full of three kinds of pain. The first kind, called <em>ƒÅdhyƒÅtmika</em>, is due to intra-organic psychophysical causes and includes all mental and bodily sufferings. The second, <em>ƒÅdhibhautika</em>, is due to extra-organic natural causes like men, beasts, birds, thorns etc. The third, <em>ƒÅdhidaivika</em>, is due to supernatural causes like the planets, elemental agencies, ghosts, demons etc. Wherever there are gu·πáas there are pains. Even the so-called pleasures lead to pain. Even the life in heaven is subject to the gu·πáas. The end of man is to get rid of these three kinds of pain and sufferings. Liberation means complete cessation of all sufferings which is the <em>summum bonum</em>, the highest end of life (Apavarga or Puru·π£ƒÅrtha).</p>
<p>Puru·π£a is free and pure consciousness. It is inactive, indifferent and possesses no attributes. Really speaking, it is above time and space, merit and demerit, bondage and liberation. It is only when it mistakes its reflection in the buddhi for itself and identifies itself wrongly with the internal organ‚Äîthe intellect, the ego and the mind, that it is said to be bound. It is the ego, and not the Puru·π£a, which is bound. When the Puru·π£a realizes its own pure nature, it gets liberated which in fact it always was. Hence bondage is due to ignorance or non-discrimination between the self and the not-self and liberation is due to right knowledge or discrimination between the self and the not-self. Liberation cannot be obtained by means of actions. Karma, good or bad or indifferent, is the function of the gu·πáas and leads to bondage and not to liberation. Good actions may lead to heaven and bad actions to hell but heaven and hell alike, like this worldly life, are subject to pain. It is only knowledge which leads to liberation because bondage is due to ignorance and ignorance can be removed only by knowledge.¬≤ The Jƒ´va has to realize itself as the pure Puru·π£a through discrimination between Puru·π£a and Prak·πõti. Actions and fruits, merits and demerits, pleasure and pain all belong to the not-self. The knowledge that 'I am not (the not-self)', that 'nothing is mine', that 'ego is unreal', when constantly meditated upon, becomes pure, incontrovertible and absolute and leads to liberation.¬≥ SƒÅ·πÖkhya</p>

<p>admits both Jƒ´vanmukti and Videhamukti. The moment right knowledge dawns, the person becomes liberated here and now, even though he may be embodied due to <em>prƒÅrabdha</em> karma. On account of the momentum of past deeds, the body continues to exist for some time, just as the wheel of a potter goes on revolving for some time due to previous momentum even though the potter has withdrawn his hand from it. As the liberated saint, though embodied, feels no association with the body, no new karma gets accumulated as all karma loses causal energy.¬π The final and the absolute emancipation, the complete disembodied isolation automatically results after death.¬≤ SƒÅ·πÖkhya liberation is a state of complete isolation, freedom from all pain, a return of the Puru·π£a to its pure nature as consciousness. There is no pleasure or happiness or bliss here, for pleasure presupposes pain and is relative to it. Pleasure is the result of sattva gu·πáa and liberation transcends all gu·πáas.</p>
<p>SƒÅ·πÖkhya believes that bondage and liberation alike are only phenomenal. The bondage of the Puru·π£a is a fiction. It is only the ego, the product of Prak·πõti, which is bound. And consequently it is only the ego which is liberated. Puru·π£a, in its complete isolation, is untouched by bondage and liberation. If Puru·π£a were really bound, it could not have obtained liberation even after hundred births, for real bondage can never be destroyed. It is Prak·πõti which is bound and Prak·πõti which is liberated. ƒ™≈õvarak·πõ·π£·πáa frankly says: Puru·π£a, therefore, is really neither bound nor is it liberated nor does it transmigrate; bondage, liberation and transmigration belong to Prak·πõti in its manifold forms.¬≥ Prak·πõti binds itself with its seven forms.‚Å¥ There is nothing finer and subtler than Prak·πõti; she is so shy that she never reappears before that Puru·π£a who has once 'seen' her in her true colours.‚Åµ Just as a dancing girl retires from the stage after entertaining the audience, similarly Prak·πõti also retires after exhibiting herself to the Puru·π£a.‚Å∂</p>

<p>THE original SƒÅ·πÖkhya was monistic and theistic. But the classical SƒÅ·πÖkhya, perhaps under the influence of Materialism, Jainism and Early Buddhism, became atheistic. It is orthodox because it believes in the authority of the Veda. It does not establish the non-existence of God. It only shows that Prak·πõti and Puru·π£as are sufficient to explain this universe and therefore there is no reason for postulating a hypothesis of God. But some commentators have tried to repudiate the existence of</p>

<p>God, while the later SƒÅ·πÖkhya writers like Vij√±ƒÅnabhik·π£u have tried to revive the necessity for admitting God. Those who repudiate the existence of God give the following arguments: if God is affected by selfish motives, He is not free; if He is free, He will not create this world of pain and misery. Either God is unjust and cruel or He is not free and all-powerful. If He is determined by the law of Karma, He is not free; if not, He is a tyrant. Again, God being pure knowledge, this material world cannot spring from Him. The effects are implicitly contained in their cause and the material world which is subject to change requires an unintelligent and ever-changing cause and not a spiritual and immutable God. Again, the eternal existence of the Puru·π£as is inconsistent with God. If they are the parts of God, they must have some divine power. If they are created by God, they are subject to destruction. Hence there is no God.</p>

<h4 id="general-estimate">GENERAL ESTIMATE<a class="headerlink" href="#general-estimate" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>LET us now proceed to give a critical estimate of the SƒÅ·πÖkhya system. The logic of the SƒÅ·πÖkhya system, like that of Jainism, impels it to embrace idealistic monism or absolutism but it clings, like Jainism, to spiritualistic pluralism and dualistic realism. The fundamental blunder of SƒÅ·πÖkhya is to treat Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a as absolutely separate and independent realities. The Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a of SƒÅ·πÖkhya thus become mere abstractions torn away from the context of concrete experience. The object and the subject are relative and not independent and absolute. Experience always unfolds them together. Like the two sides of the same coin, they are the two aspects of the same reality. To dig a chasm between them is to undermine them both. And that is what SƒÅ·πÖkhya has done. The logic of SƒÅ·πÖkhya requires it to maintain the ultimate reality of the transcendental Puru·π£a alone and to regard Prak·πõti as its inseparable power. When this Puru·π£a is reflected in its own power Prak·πõti, it becomes the empirical ego, the Jƒ´va, the phenomenal. Plurality belongs to this Jƒ´va, not to the transcendental Puru·π£a. The subject and the object, the Jƒ´va and the Prak·πõti, are the two aspects of the Puru·π£a which is their transcendental background. It is the Puru·π£a which sustains the empirical dualism between Prak·πõti and Jƒ´va and which finally transcends it. Every Jƒ´va is the potential Puru·π£a and liberation consists in the actualization of this potentiality. This is the philosophy to which the SƒÅ·πÖkhya logic points and which is throughout implicit in SƒÅ·πÖkhya, but which is explicitly rejected by SƒÅ·πÖkhya with the inevitable and unfortunate result that SƒÅ·πÖkhya has reduced itself to a bundle of contradictions. If Prak·πõti and Puru·π£a are absolute and independent, they can never come into contact and hence there can be no evolution at all. As</p></div>
