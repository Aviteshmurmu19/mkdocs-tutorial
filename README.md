# My Notes: A Digital Archive of College Lectures

[My Notes](https://aviteshmurmu19.github.io/mkdocs-tutorial/)

Welcome to "My Notes," a personal project dedicated to transforming raw college lecture transcripts into a living, searchable, and interconnected knowledge base. The mission of this project is to create a well-structured and easily accessible resource for studying, revision, and deep-diving into complex academic topics.

This site is built to be a scalable and permanent digital archive, ensuring that knowledge is not only preserved but also made discoverable and easy to navigate for anyone, anywhere.

### Key Features

- **Modern, Responsive Design:** The notes are presented in a clean, professional, and mobile-friendly interface, making them readable on any device, from a phone to a desktop monitor.
- **Powerful Full-Text Search:** Instantly find any keyword, concept, or lecture across all semesters and courses with a highly accurate client-side search engine.
- **Topic-Based Tagging:** Every lecture and course is tagged with relevant keywords (e.g., "Calculus," "Thermodynamics"). This allows you to explore connections between topics across different subjects and semesters.
- **Automated & Logical Navigation:** The site's structure is always up-to-date. As new notes are added, the navigation sidebar automatically organizes them by semester and course, requiring zero manual configuration.
- **Rich Content Formatting:** Lecture notes go beyond plain text, incorporating:
  - **Code Blocks** with syntax highlighting for technical examples.
  - **Mathematical Formulas** rendered beautifully with LaTeX.
  - **Diagrams and Flowcharts** to visualize complex systems.
  - **Callouts and Content Tabs** to highlight key information and provide multiple perspectives.
- **Always Live and Up-to-Date:** Hosted on GitHub Pages, the site is automatically rebuilt and deployed whenever new notes are added, ensuring you're always viewing the latest version.

### Content Philosophy

This project follows a few core principles to ensure the notes are not just stored, but are genuinely useful:

1.  **Structure is King:** All content is organized hierarchically by **Semester → Course → Lecture**. This predictable structure makes it easy to find specific material.
2.  **Consistency is Key:** Every lecture note, course overview, and semester dashboard follows a standardized template. This creates a consistent reading experience and ensures all necessary information (like course codes, topics, and references) is always in the same place.
3.  **Interconnectivity:** Knowledge isn't siloed. Through tags and cross-links, a concept mentioned in a first-year course can be easily linked to an advanced topic in a later semester, creating a web of interconnected ideas.

### Technology Stack

This project is built entirely on modern, open-source tools that are perfect for creating documentation and knowledge bases:

- **MkDocs:** A fast, simple, and powerful static site generator.
- **Material for MkDocs:** A feature-rich and beautiful theme that provides most of the functionality you see.
- **Markdown:** The simple and intuitive syntax used for writing all notes.
- **Key Plugins:** The site relies on the `tags` plugin for topic indexing and the `awesome-nav` plugin for automated navigation generation.
- **GitHub Pages:** For reliable, free, and fast hosting.

### How to Navigate This Site

There are several ways to find what you're looking for:

- **Use the Sidebar:** The primary navigation on the left is always visible and organized by semester and course.
- **Use the Tags Page:** Visit the dedicated "Tags" page to see an index of all topics. Clicking on a tag will show you every lecture and course associated with it.
- **Use the Search Bar:** The search bar at the top is the fastest way to find a specific term anywhere on the site.

This project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive personal knowledge management system. I hope you find these notes as useful as I do.
